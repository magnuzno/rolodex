        "Abstract": "The benefits of riblets on reducing drag has been established and reverified over the years since the technology\u2019s inception in the 1980s. Unfortunately, transitioning riblets from machined aluminum panels to a format that can be utilized for large scale aerospace applications has been unsuccessful. Applique riblet films required significant application time and specialized workers. Utilizing photocurable coatings is a complex process that is beyond current industry capabilities. MTech believes there is an opportunity to leverage commercialized laser technology and apply it in a novel way to produce riblets directly into an already coated and cured surface utilizing direct laser interference patterning (DLIP). This technology would enable an economically feasible large-scale production of riblets on the range of 50-100 microns by a contact\/wear-free continuous process. MTech has adopted specific technical objectives that define the research required to verify the geometric detail and resulting chemical composition of DLIP applied riblets. MTech will research and demonstrate the micro scale geometry capabilities of the DLIP process on a standard cured MIL-PRF-85285 Type IV topcoat. The MIL-PRF-85285 coating containing the riblets will tested for conformance with the specification requirements to include, but not limited to, the following: gloss, tape resistance, adhesion, heat resistance, color, fluid resistance, solvent resistance, cleanability, weather resistance, and impact flexibility. These tests will confirm the durability of the riblets in the uniquely harsh operational environment that Naval aircraft experience. The impacts of riblets on routine maintenance will be invested and the maintenance level of any maintenance tasks will be determined. A detailed BCA will be conducted highlighting the benefits of riblet production via DLIP versus projected reduction in fuel consumption. These key objectives will demonstrate the necessary technological maturity of the DLIP process to move rapidly to a commercialized application of both military and commercial aircraft."

        "Abstract": "Metal additive manufacturing (AM), particularly, laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) has transformative potential to achieve geometric design freedom at low production volumes. However, porosity and localized defects remain a significant challenge to implementation in mission critical aerospace applications. While the quality of LPBF is now competitive with or surpasses castings for established materials such as Stainless Steel 304 or 316, increased demands based on enhanced geometry require stringent certification before the printed components can be used in applications experiencing cyclic loading. Researchers at Notre Dame have demonstrated machine learning techniques for analyzing the integrity of printed parts from data stored during the manufacturing process. The main objective of this proposal is to complete the initial design and testing of an Automated Manufacturing Process Analysis System. This device will 1) to eliminate the need to store large amounts of data for post-processing, 2) aggregate and synchronize data from multiple sensors, 3) synthesize data into features and interpolate onto a voxelized space, 4) allow the results of off-line trained machine learning algorithms to be applied forward and 5) enable future layer-to-layer process control."

        "Abstract": "While additive manufacturing (AM) has enabled the fabrication of complex geometries, process repeatability, and part quality has been an inhibitor to widespread industry adoption. Parts fabricated using metal AM can have their mechanical properties compromised due to the presence of defects. Presently, quality assurance is achieved by X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), which is costly and time-consuming. In-situ monitoring in AM can help in the democratization of AM by offering real-time detection of anomalies. This research aims to develop artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI\/ML) algorithms that use the data generated by the machine sensors in conjunction with inexpensive optical and acoustic sensors to detect defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) in real-time. \u00a0 The popular EOS-M290 LPBF machine has 20+ in-built sensors such as O2 concentration, chamber temperature, layer time, recoater speed, etc. This machine data in conjunction with optical and acoustic data will be used to develop AI\/ML models for real-time issue detection. A high-resolution optical camera will be mounted on the EOS M290 LPBF machine to collect layer-by-layer images. These images will be analyzed by an artificial intelligence (AI) model trained to detect layer anomalies such as spatter, streaking, hopping, part swelling, etc. An acoustic sensor will be deployed to capture airborne sound waves and analyzed to identify features denoting the evolution and presence of defects. AI\/ML algorithms will combine or fuse the data from the different sensors to provide higher accuracy of detection. This project will use the underutilized machine data to achieve high special and temporal information of defects. This project will further build on the current capability of Addiguru\u2019s optical camera-based layerwise real-time monitoring technology which detects issues using computer vision and AI. \u00a0 Data will be generated by printing samples that will be deliberately designed to include various defects. This data will be analyzed and used for training AI\/ML models. The training of the AI\/ML models requires labeling of data with the ground truth which will be obtained by performing CT scans. CT scans will determine porosity in the parts. Metallographic analysis will be carried out to uncover issues and train the models. \u00a0 Combining in-situ machine sensor data along with optical and acoustics signals will provide a significant enhancement in the detection of anomalies. The data fusion will be carried out by developing advanced AI\/ML algorithms by Addiguru\u2019s AI\/ML and software engineering experts. It is proposed that high spatial and temporal resolution obtained by fusing multiple sensor data will enable precise location of defects and thereby, significantly reduce post-build inspection costs. Successful completion of the project will demonstrate the feasibility to develop AI\/ML algorithms for multiple sensory data for real-time issue detection in the LPBF process."

        "Abstract": "To address the Navy\u2019s need for next generation heads-up displays (HUDs) to provide training aids, operational tools, and situational awareness (SA) visualizations, Intellisense Systems, Inc. proposes to develop a new Wide-angle Augmented-Reality Infantry Operational Robust Heads-Up-Display (WARIOR-HUD) based on an innovative integration of a wide field-of-view (FOV) conformal layered optical spheroid lens optics with curved holographic waveguide, a high resolution tiled liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCOS) laser-illuminated light engine with a foveating combiner layout, and a multiplexed video parsing electronic processor. Specifically, the innovation in the proposed system design will enable WARIOR-HUD to be low cost, provide better FOV and resolution than current high-resolution training and tactical HUD\/HMD systems, and meet the Navy\u2019s cost and performance requirements. As a result, the WARIOR-HUD offers panoramic high-resolution, high frame-rate imagery with full motion tracking and allows the users\/soldiers to see all the surrounding area and interact with each other safely. In Phase I, Intellisense will design a WARIOR-HSD that meets or exceeds the Navy\u2019s requirements, determine its feasibility through experiments, develop an initial prototype and testing its performance addressing human factor issues, and develop a prototype plan for Phase II, addressing refined hardware and software requirements for Marine Corps use in close-air support (CAS) and call-for-fire (CFF) missions. In Phase II, Intellisense will develop and demonstrate two functional WARIOR-HUD prototypes, evaluate their performance, compare their performance with current training simulators and tactical HUD systems for potential Marine Corps use in CAS and CFF missions, and identify areas for improvement."

        "Abstract": "Global Engineering and Materials, Inc. and Professor Jinhui Yan at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign propose to develop an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering simulation toolkit for optimal tailoring of gas flow in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) and direct energy deposition (DED) to reduce defects (e.g., porosity and spatter) and surface roughness improve quality (e.g., microhardness and heat-affected zone). The proposed tool, Additive Manufacturing Gas Flow Simulator (AM-GFS), quantifies the gas flow characteristics such as nozzle flow in DED and gas circulation in PBF, and predicts defect\/quality index for the component-level print as typical in the aircraft. The model capability highlights are summarized as follows: 1) multi-scale model that couples the gas flow phenomena in powder-scale and chamber-\/nozzle-scale. 2) High-fidelity powder-scale physics modeling that resolves the laser absorption, molten pool, vapor jet, gas entrainment, and spattered particles. 3) Full validation using in-situ and ex-situ data (e.g., surface profile, spatter count, and molten pool size). 4) Physics-informed machine learning (ML) based surrogate models that are trained based on simulation data to fast produce process-to-defect relationship. 5) Cross-process models which are robust to accommodate both DED and PBF processes. The results from the AM-GFS tool will establish a process map that delineates the boundaries of high defect index region in a gas-flow parameter space. Such capability will accelerate the process design iterations to identify the optimal gas flow that minimizes defects."

In this proposal we present an exciting ultra-precision optics polishing method based on the EEM method that, we believe, will greatly improve the surface figure and roughness of the other X-ray mirrors used in those beamlines, specifically the interior surfaces of the Wolter Mirrors. The current EEM method is not capable of polishing these interior surfaces, but a novel Fluid Jet Polishing Elastic Emission Machining (FJPEEM) system proposed herein, will be capable of just that.

        "Abstract": "Biological imaging with molecular specificity is most often achieved using fluorescent labeling. Fluorescent light for image contrast is also the basis of most optical \u201csuper-resolution\u201d techniques that achieve far-field spatial resolution beyond the classical limit. However, non-invasive imaging techniques have been developed that use only native fluorophores, or bypass fluorescence in favor of other forms of inherent (endogenous) contrast. Molecular identification can be done endogenously by probingthe Raman spectrum, although this is a weak process and requires coherent methods to enhance the signal using pulsed lasers. To date, non-fluorescent super-resolution imaging methods that target coherent nonlinear processes such as coherent Raman spectroscopy and harmonic generation have been exceedingly rare and demonstrated limited effectiveness. We will build an imaging system for examining endogenous contrast mechanisms in biological samples, with chemical specificity, achieving super-resolution for all contrast mechanisms including coherent Raman scattering. We will employ a novel use of an imaging scheme known as multiphoton spatial- frequency modulated imaging. In Phase I, we will build the microscope and characterize its imaging performance. Performance will be measured with test targets and compared to numerical models. We will demonstrate resolution-enhanced biological imaging of endogenous fluorophores, coherent Raman signals, and harmonic generation signals. We plan to target structures that are relevant to metabolic processes with applications toward biofuel generation. Our proposed instrument will provide a valuable tool enabling biological research to proceed with enhanced spatial resolution for a variety of contrast mechanisms beyond fluorescence. Our technology can be added as a bolt-on module to the front end of existing multiphoton microscopes, or be built as a stand-alone instrument. The technology is relatively insensitive to wavelength, and can be used toprovide enhanced resolution of nonlinear signals from the UV to the mid-infrared. Other application spaces for our instrument include materials science, advanced manufacturing, biomedical research, and homeland security."

        "Abstract": "Small, modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) offer the promise of reliable, base-load energy that is not dependent on weather. Currently, around a dozen nations have programs to develop and deploy MSRs. Challenges to the deployment of MSRs are due primarily to the corrosive and dynamic molten salt. For safe operation of the reactor it is paramount to accurately monitorandcontrolthemoltensalt properties. Measuring viscosity and density data improve safety and lead to efficiency optimization for flow through fuel and coolant heat exchangers. The viscosity and density measurements must be high-throughput and require only a small amount of fluid. The measurements also need to be precise, and the instrument must withstand the extreme, corrosive temperature and radiation environment of the molten salt. Viscosity and density measurement using cantilever oscillators to serve these challenging needs are of interest. This project proposes a viscosity and density measurement probe made out of diamond for use in molten salt reactors. The technology is based on measurements of the resonant vibrational modes of a cantilever oscillator submerged in the molten salt. The position of the resonant modes allows for determination of the viscosity and density. The oscillator is made from diamond so that it can withstand the harsh conditions of the molten salt. Also, the diamond allows for the optical detection and readout of the oscillator vibrations using a reflecting laser interferometry. GLCT will synthesize the diamond and process it into the cantilever oscillators. Photolithography and structure masking will be done at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) using the General User Program. Dry etching will be done at GLCT. Amplitude-frequency testing of the prototypes devices will be done at ANL. Success in the proposed effort will allow for the better monitoring of nuclear molten salt reactors, which will increase their safety, efficiency and commercial viability. Nuclear molten salt reactors overcome the primary hazard of traditional nuclear reactors; there is no meltdown risk with molten salt reactors. They are safer than traditional technology because they use molten salt as coolant rather than water, and because they operate at relatively low pressure near atmospheric. The waste from molten salt reactors is significantly less radioactive than traditional nuclear reactor technology. New, 100 megawatt thorium-MSRs are estimated to produce energy for $2,000 per watt compared to $2,300 per watt for coal and $4000 per watt for traditional nuclear."

        "Abstract": "There are two principal technical limitations and challenges associated with bioimaging. First, depth imaging is limited by light scattering and diffraction in biological tissue. Second, classical high flux multiphoton optical imaging causes photo-damage to cellular viability and perturbations to molecular biological processes. This renders the sample unusable for repeated in situ imaging and prohibits measurements of dynamic biological processes within the same biological system over different time intervals. Technologies utilizing single photon detection, with the promise of very low photon fluxes, single photon sensing, time gated photon sensing and ghost imaging using entangled photon pairs capabilities, promise to directly address the above challenges and limitations. While there is considerable activity towards the development of quantum photon sources (e.g., solid state lasers and systems for generation of entangled photons), there is significantly less research and development devoted to quantum photon detectors, i.e., single photon avalanche photodetectors (SPADs). Further, efforts on SPADs have been solely limited to those operating in the visible and telecommunications bands, and not in the biologically important 2080-2340 nm band which is a local minimum in the optical absorption of H2O. SPADS operating at 2080-2340 nm are required for development of the next generation of quantum bioimaging system technology. In this DoE SBIR program, Amethyst Research will develop a technology that will be able to deliver a new class of photo detectors directly addressing the current \u2018technology gap\u2019 of SPADs operating in the 2080-2340 nm window. These detectors will be designed to be suitable for integration into avalanche photodiode arrays (for direct imaging) or linear arrays for laser photon scanning imaging systems, or as single detectors for sensing. The overall Phase I Objectives will be to design and demonstrate the operation of a Single Photon Detector Technology operating in the 2080 \u2013 2340 nm band for the quantum biosensing and bioimaging community: \u2022 Design and modeling of novel 2080-2340 nm GaSb-based SPAD device architectures \u2022 Epitaxial growth of GaSb -based SPAD devices \u2022 DC electro-optical characterization of GaSb -based SPAD devices \u2022 Demonstration of superior performance of GaSb materials for SPAD devices These detectors will provide a critically needed technology for integration into systems for bioimaging, chemical sensing, quantum sensing and imaging when delivered as avalanche photodiode arrays (for direct imaging) or linear arrays for laser photon scanning imaging systems, or as single detectors for sensing."

        "Abstract": "C55-04b-270703The photonic approach to quantum information processing and networking is promising \u2013 it is expected that the quantum internet will be substantially built on optical fiber networks, where qubits can be exchanged over long distances via photons with wavelengths in the telecom range. The field of quantum photonics is continually developing and devices are being fabricated on scalable integrated photonic platforms, including silicon-on-insulator and silicon nitride. However, the heterogeneous integration of quantum photonic devices with optical fibers presents a challenge: The inherent insertion loss or limited coupling efficiency between chip and fiber limits the exchange of quantum information. While such insertion losses are typically overcome in classical photonics by simply increasing the power of the light source, this is not an option for quantum devices that operate at the level of single photons. The fact that quantum light sources and photon detectors may operate at cryogenic temperatures further complicates the fiber packaging problem. Low-loss coupling and packaging structures optimized for room temperature operation will experience deleterious reductions in coupling coupling efficiency owing to differential thermal contraction and shifts in temperature dependent refractive indices of the package and photonic circuit materials. As a result, there is a need for new fiber-chip photonic packaging solutions that can achieve low insertion loss over a wide temperature range. At memQ, we are developing quantum internet technologies based on rare earth ion (REI) optical transitions that operate in the telecom C-band. These sources of single photons and potential quantum memories are integrated directly with silicon photonic circuits, enabling the scalable fabrication of devices for managing quantum entanglement at the network-level, e.g., quantum repeaters. We have identified high insertion loss as a critical challenge to be overcome for the development of the quantum internet, and we have teamed up with Freedom Photonics, a leading laser manufacturer in California, to tackle this challenge. In Phase I of this SBIR, we will address two engineering challenges for low-loss cryogenic photonic packaging: (1) thermomechanical stability of the fiber-chip package and (2) Optical mode mismatch between photonic waveguides and fibers. We will address these challenges using the novel packaging technique of photonic wirebonding (PWB) in which flexible waveguides can be 3D-printed between chip and fiber. Freedom Photonics operates the first PWB tool in the US. Using PWB and thermally-engineered packaging, we seek to demonstrate insertion losses less than 3 dB at 4 K, at parity with those achieved at room temperature. The focus of Phase II will be to push for smaller insertion losses, to integrate our Er-doped photonic cavity devices with this new packaging, and to network devices together in two separate cryostats. This improved packaging will enable more efficient single photon sources. Based on our discussions with over 100 stakeholders in the community, these single photon sources would be valuable to researchers and engineers working on quantum networking and computing. Further, improved optical packaging will have considerable impact on the photonics industry, which is expected to approach $1 trillion in value by 2028."

        "Abstract": "Biological imaging with molecular specificity is most often achieved using fluorescent labeling. Fluorescent light for image contrast is also the basis of most optical \u201csuper-resolution\u201d techniques that achieve far-field spatial resolution beyond the classical limit. However, non-invasive imaging techniques have been developed that use only native fluorophores, or bypass fluorescence in favor of other forms of inherent (endogenous) contrast. Molecular identification can be done endogenously by probingthe Raman spectrum, although this is a weak process and requires coherent methods to enhance the signal using pulsed lasers. To date, non-fluorescent super-resolution imaging methods that target coherent nonlinear processes such as coherent Raman spectroscopy and harmonic generation have been exceedingly rare and demonstrated limited effectiveness. We will build an imaging system for examining endogenous contrast mechanisms in biological samples, with chemical specificity, achieving super-resolution for all contrast mechanisms including coherent Raman scattering. We will employ a novel use of an imaging scheme known as multiphoton spatial- frequency modulated imaging. In Phase I, we will build the microscope and characterize its imaging performance. Performance will be measured with test targets and compared to numerical models. We will demonstrate resolution-enhanced biological imaging of endogenous fluorophores, coherent Raman signals, and harmonic generation signals. We plan to target structures that are relevant to metabolic processes with applications toward biofuel generation. Our proposed instrument will provide a valuable tool enabling biological research to proceed with enhanced spatial resolution for a variety of contrast mechanisms beyond fluorescence. Our technology can be added as a bolt-on module to the front end of existing multiphoton microscopes, or be built as a stand-alone instrument. The technology is relatively insensitive to wavelength, and can be used toprovide enhanced resolution of nonlinear signals from the UV to the mid-infrared. Other application spaces for our instrument include materials science, advanced manufacturing, biomedical research, and homeland security."

        "Abstract": "Small, modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) offer the promise of reliable, base-load energy that is not dependent on weather. Currently, around a dozen nations have programs to develop and deploy MSRs. Challenges to the deployment of MSRs are due primarily to the corrosive and dynamic molten salt. For safe operation of the reactor it is paramount to accurately monitorandcontrolthemoltensalt properties. Measuring viscosity and density data improve safety and lead to efficiency optimization for flow through fuel and coolant heat exchangers. The viscosity and density measurements must be high-throughput and require only a small amount of fluid. The measurements also need to be precise, and the instrument must withstand the extreme, corrosive temperature and radiation environment of the molten salt. Viscosity and density measurement using cantilever oscillators to serve these challenging needs are of interest. This project proposes a viscosity and density measurement probe made out of diamond for use in molten salt reactors. The technology is based on measurements of the resonant vibrational modes of a cantilever oscillator submerged in the molten salt. The position of the resonant modes allows for determination of the viscosity and density. The oscillator is made from diamond so that it can withstand the harsh conditions of the molten salt. Also, the diamond allows for the optical detection and readout of the oscillator vibrations using a reflecting laser interferometry. GLCT will synthesize the diamond and process it into the cantilever oscillators. Photolithography and structure masking will be done at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) using the General User Program. Dry etching will be done at GLCT. Amplitude-frequency testing of the prototypes devices will be done at ANL. Success in the proposed effort will allow for the better monitoring of nuclear molten salt reactors, which will increase their safety, efficiency and commercial viability. Nuclear molten salt reactors overcome the primary hazard of traditional nuclear reactors; there is no meltdown risk with molten salt reactors. They are safer than traditional technology because they use molten salt as coolant rather than water, and because they operate at relatively low pressure near atmospheric. The waste from molten salt reactors is significantly less radioactive than traditional nuclear reactor technology. New, 100 megawatt thorium-MSRs are estimated to produce energy for $2,000 per watt compared to $2,300 per watt for coal and $4000 per watt for traditional nuclear."

New small-pitch detector solutions are being developed which necessitates development of complimentary Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and reliable, high-density, low capacitance, readily manufacturable integration technologies to interconnect silicon pixel detectors with high density CMOS front-end integrated circuits. Overall objective of combined Phase I\/Phase II project: Finalize design for the new custom multi-tier ASIC with Tier 1 \u2013 preamplifier, discriminator and charge injector, Tier 2 \u2013 Time-to-Digital converter and Tier 3 \u2013 readout circuitry while concurrently developing a versatile, high-density, high-yield, low-capacitance vertical integration approach based on modified direct bond interconnect technology (MoDiBI) to demonstrate vertically integrated multi-tier ASIC assembly. What was done in Phase I? Completed an optimized design for Tier 1 with simulated jitter of ~10ps. Developed a full detector array level thermo- mechanical model for 250\u00b5m-pitch ASIC based 3D integrated assembly complemented by experimental demonstration of LGAD-ETROC1 integration. The prototypes were tested successfully at Fermilab by electrical connectivity and charge injection tests for functionality. The Phase II effort is aimed at devising overall architecture of 250\u00b5m\u00d7250\u00b5m-pixel three-tier ASIC. Overall performance of the designed tiers will be validated by circuit SPICE simulation post-layout prior to tape-out to a foundry. Multi-tier integration technology will be demonstrated Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) and high-density, low- capacitance integration scheme employing patented Modified Direct Bond Interconnect technology supplemented by the 3D thermo-mechanical models for longer-term reliability. Large area hybridization techniques, die-to-wafer and wafer-to-wafer will be demonstrated for cost-effective solution. Fabricated individual ASIC tiers as well as final multi-tier assembly will be tested at Fermilab for operation by electrical connectivity and charge injection tests. Novel small-pixel, multi-tier ASIC integrated with high-density, low capacitance Modified Direct Bond Interconnect technology will find immediate application in detector chips to be used in newly conceived advanced Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) for precision timing and position application. Longer term applications include full vertically integrated highly segmented, high-density detectors for nuclear particle detectors, advanced infrared detector for defense and security application for active imaging systems, such as LAser Detection And Ranging (LADAR) and a wide variety of medical imaging applications such as Clinical dosimetry, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to name a few."

        "Abstract": "C53-12a-271184Photocathodes are critical for generation of high-brightness electron beams in accelerators that are used in science, industry, and medical disciplines. A visible wavelength-tunable picoseconds laser is required to support optimization of photocathodes leading to more compact, high-performance, and cost-effective systems. Such lasers are not available commercially. With new sources of high-brightness electron beams affordable for universities, commercial laboratories (e.g., semiconductor material development), and hospitals, the US would be able to maintain its technological leadership. In Phase I, we constructed a proof-of-principle Demonstrator system and experimentally validated our concept. We demonstrated key parameters targeted by the DOE including wavelength tunability from 484 to 643 nm, pulse energy up to 425 \u00b5J, and output bandwidth as low as 1 nm. We characterized the performance of the demonstrator system, anchored our predictive models, confirmed energetics, validated the pulse synchronization, and used these results to design the Phase II Prototype driver. Our accomplishments generated an interest by the researchers at a DOE laboratory. In Phase II, we will develop and characterize a prototype photocathode drive laser meeting the DOE functional requirements. Results of Phase I will be extended using our validated approach. Effective thermal management will be implemented for the PA, harmonic conversion crystals, and the OPA crystals to facilitate continuous operation at high-average power. Wavelength selection under computer control with a feedback loop will be created. Means for pulse selection and generation of the objective waveform will be developed. Pulse synchronization at picosecond level will be matured. Spatial pulse shaping will be provided. Temporal pulse shaping will be evaluated. The resulting laser system will be a full-scale prototype offering a direct path to a photocathode drive laser deliverable in Phase III. Commercial applications for a tunable high-average power laser based on the Aqwest concept include science, remote environmental sensing (illuminator for active hyperspectral imaging), and industrial laser material processing."

        "Abstract": "C53-12a-271285Current electron accelerator technologies are fundamentally limited by the photoinjector, where efficient generation of electron bunches with low emittance is required. Many facilities currently use photocathode materials with excitation by high power ultraviolet pulses, which places extreme demands on system components. Therefore, photocathode materials operating in the visible spectrum are being developed. One impediment to a systematic characterization of these materials is the lack of a suitable high-power excitation laser that is tunable across a wide range with high performance. We propose a laser-driven optical parametric amplification system, which will provide tunable 10\u2019s of picosecond pulses in the visible spectrum at high energy and high repetition rate. Our system emphasizes efficiency in the tunable laser system design to scale to high average power. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of our proposed technique for the generation of tunable visible pulses for photocathode characterization. We built a prototype novel nonlinear fiber- amplifier seed source and constructed an optical parametric amplifier followed by conversion to tunable visible pulses, at 200kHz repetition rate. Experiments were guided by a numerical model. In Phase II, we will scale our tunable laser system to high average power. We will build a fiber amplifier and parametric amplifier operating at 1 MHz repetition rate, ultimately outputting tunable microjoule pulses of tens of picoseconds duration. Extended numerical models will guide and optimize system performance. Our proposed instrument will provide a valuable tool that can ultimately enable next generation electron accelerator user facilities to operate on a smaller footprint, be built at lower cost, and enhance availability, therefore increasing applications in the medical, research, and security sectors. Our proposed instrument also serves the ultrafast laser market by providing both tunable picosecond pulses, and amplified femtosecond pulses in spectral regions that lack broad gain bandwidths in standard laser materials."

To push the knowledge frontier of these sciences, X-ray sources are being continually upgraded for properties such as vastly increased brightness or needle-sharp focus. As a consequence, scientists come up against the limits of existing X-ray detectors to take pictures of intense X- ray pulses, and therefore they require new, advanced detectors with which to record their X-ray patterns. This grant will be used to develop high end detector sensing electronics, and with them design and produce a new high-resolution pixelated detector for taking high speed pictures of X-ray patterns. The grant will improve a detector design to better absorb and detect the X-rays without them passing through the sensor layer. This detector is special because it quickly integrates signals from X-ray patterns and can record intense pulses at orders of magnitude higher rate than is possible with existing commercial detector products used at these facilities. This detector is also a perfect companion for free electron laser sources, which have few suitable options for measuring the near-instantaneous X-ray diffraction and scattering patterns. The Phase IIA project builds on the Phase II project, the fruits of which were: the development of mechanical designs, cryogenic cooling, control software, and the improvement of the integrating circuits. A larger area detector and a better X-ray sensing material will be designed and produced under this grant, to capture more of the X-rays that are emitted during these experiments. The excellent data quality produced by this new detector will inform many branches of science utilizing the diffraction, scattering, and microscopy techniques at these X-ray facilities. Researchers will be able to develop useful new technologies, such as improve aerospace materials with stress and strain measurements, design faster better batteries or three-dimensional printing techniques, or even determine the structure and kinetics of biomolecules, leading to advances in medicine and pharmaceuticals."

        "Abstract": "The Multisensor Insitu Data with Machine Learning (MIDML) program will develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to leverage data generated from multiple AM inprocess sensors. This can provide more accurate and reliable assessments and predictions of final part quality during layer-by-layer fabrication, in real time. The CNN will be\u00a0developed for maximum prediction accuracy from multiple sensor inputs using CT scans of the finished part to provide \u201cground truth\u201d of final melt quality. Employing insitu data, corrective action can be taken much earlier in the manufacturing cycle to improve part quality, process yield and cost effectiveness of AM for critical applications. The MIDML program will initially leverage\u00a0LPBF data already developed under six prior AM inprocess inspection contracts performed by Quartus and its partners for DoD and NASA. This includes inprocess and final part microCT data that has been volumetrically registered. This approach permits starting CNN development immediately on Day 1. Then, during the remainder of the Phase I BASE program, we will fabricate new test specimens while capturing three inprocess sensing modalities simultaneously:\u00a0thermal tomography, laser profilometry, and melt pool monitoring. Coupons will be microCT scanned and the data used to refine and then test the effectiveness of our CNN."

        "Abstract": "C53-24a-271332For long-term CO2 sequestration monitoring, it is important to detect elevated levels of metal contaminants such as Ca, K, Sr, etc., is soil and water as it can provide an early detection of CO2 leakage from geologic carbon storage. Technologies are also needed for direct and in situ measurements of greenhouse gases, CO2 and CH4 for environmental monitoring. For in situ and real-time measurements, we employed a DOE patented split laser measurement technology (SLMT) for laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to measure elemental species (Na, Ca and Sr) and Raman spectroscopy to measure CO2 and CH4 under harsh environmental conditions. A significant part of the effort was devoted to the upgrade of the current SLMT by incorporating innovative packaging and sealing of the sensor head for ruggedness and to withstand the harsh environments anticipated during underwater and downhole sensing applications. We successfully built a compact and sealed prototype split laser that delivered high-energy nanosecond pulses and was able to perform LIBS experiments for species detection of Na, Ca, Sr, Eu, and Yb and obtain limits of detection on the level of 10~25 parts per million in aqueous solutions. Different combinations of spectral analyzers and photon detectors were tested, thereby permitting a study on the relative performance and cost analyses. Raman spectroscopy was also successfully demonstrated to detect dissolved CO2 in water. Based on the promising results obtained during Phase I, we will continue to refine the split laser to further enhance its performance and built three sensors \u2013 a LIBS sensor, a NIR Raman sensor, and a NIR cavity enhanced Raman spectroscopy (CERS) sensor, for in situ, standoff monitoring of trace metals and dissolved gases in water and validate its performance using laboratory experiments and field tests deep underground in downhole configuration. The validation of these sensors using field tests will lead to the development of rugged sensors that are capable of field deployment. Further refinement of these rugged sensors will lead to mature products that can be commercialized. The proposed system will support laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and Raman scattering measurements of gases, liquids, and solids. There is a great need in providing an inexpensive and compact measurement device suitable for real-time assessment of air, water, and soil quality, which is highly important to oil and gas exploration companies, landowners, regulatory agencies, municipalities, and any organization measuring emissions and pollutants."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes improving the reproducibility of automated life science workflows while simultaneously reducing their carbon footprint. Automated life science workflows are increasingly prevalent in medical (e.g., laboratory tests and diagnostics) and research (e.g., next generation sequencing) applications, and mixing is a ubiquitous and often repeatedly performed operation in these assays. The novel mixing technology to be developed will confer myriad benefits. By reducing assay turnaround times and improving assay reliability, it will decrease wait times for medical screening, diagnosis and monitoring, enabling faster diagnoses and treatments. By decreasing the materials costs of the assays, this technology may reduce the costs of medical testing and improve access to care. It also can enhance partnerships between academic and industry laboratories by giving academic laboratories access to industry workflows that are currently prohibitively expensive. Finally, by eliminating a substantial portion of the single-use plastic consumed by assays, this novel mixing technology will help curb the waste generated by life science assays, which will help alleviate the single-use plastic waste crisis. _x000D__x000D_\nThe proposed project will deliver an innovative mixing technology that is based on a photo-acoustic streaming phenomenon. Briefly, when glass implanted with metal nanoparticles (metal-implanted materials (MIMs)) is excited by a pulsed laser, it causes an adjacent fluid (liquid or gas) to begin streaming for the duration of the illumination. This streaming creates an opportunity to precisely control mixing, but key technical challenges include optimizing the MIMs\u2019 form factor and devising an effective, yet also inexpensive, illumination system. The proposed project\u2019s objectives address these challenges by: (i) evaluating the effectiveness of mixing solutions with a novel MIM form factor that can be incorporated easily into existing automated life science workflows, (ii) determining if functional MIMs can be fabricated in bulk by procuring them from a supplier and characterizing them for nanoparticle implantation and laser-induced solution streaming, and (iii) testing an alternative laser light source that powers mixing and consists of a low-cost light emitting diode (LED) laser._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in developing technology that will enable the use of a 3-dimensional (3D) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system in smaller and more economical drones for mapping, surveying, and navigation.The 3D LiDAR has important applications in environment management, forestry, land and corridor mapping, construction, land surveying, precision agriculture, powerline and infrastructure inspection, and countless other areas. The technology will bring significant economic impacts to the industries by reducing the ownership costs of a high-performance LiDAR system and the drone that can carry this system. The reduction of the entry-cost for LiDAR applications with drones will in turn benefit small businesses to perform smaller-scale projects in mapping and surveying. Other than drone-based applications, the innovation is poised to significantly reduce the costs and provide seamless integration of 3D LiDAR sensing in self-driving vehicles and other industrial applications including robotics, smart city infrastructure, surveillance, and security, as well as consumer applications like 3D sensing for augmented reality. The numerous applications enabled by the proposed project not will only help increase the economic competitiveness of the U.S. but also improve quality of life, security and safety._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe proposed project aims at developing a high-performance, compact, and light-weight 3D LiDAR sensor to meet the increasing needs of drone-based, high-precision LiDAR applications. Current commercial high-performance drone-LiDAR systems are notorious for their high cost, bulkiness, heavy weight, and high power-consumption.Current drone-LiDAR systems are also prone to mechanical damage. These issues inevitably shorten the drone flight time, inhibit the installations of high-performance LiDAR systems on the more common consumer-grade small drones, and increase the operation costs. The proposed LiDAR sensor will mitigate all of these issues by leveraging a high-performance coherent LiDAR detection approach with silicon photonics technology in an innovative design. The coherent LiDAR detection method allows more sensitive measurements than the method used in most existing LiDAR systems. The technology achieves a longer detection range and larger number of returns given the same laser power. Based on highly scalable Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible silicon photonics technology, the LiDAR sensor is able to achieve high spatial resolution in a compact size. The entire system will have a form-factor similar to a palm-sized compact camera commonly used for photogrammetry in small drones. The solution requires no mechanical mechanisms for beam scanning nor high-precision alignment of optical components, making the system inherently durable, compact, lightweight, and power efficient._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader\/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to simplify and significantly reduce the cost of optical component fabrication. Optical components, with well-known examples being mirrors, polarizers, and lenses, are essential building blocks in a host of civilian and military systems including imaging, telecommunications, and laser systems. Current optical component technology is a multi-billion-dollar industry and is based on multiple layers of films deposited in vacuum chambers. The proposed innovation realizes a new optical component class with the functionality of multi-film assemblies generated in a single layer with attendant savings in time and cost. The project focuses on the long-wave infrared spectral domain where traditional thin-film technology is impractical due to the extreme film thicknesses needed. The long-wave domain covers a region of atmospheric transparency essential for terrestrial imaging, medical and industrial laser technologies, and night-vision systems. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis innovation focuses on optical component fabrication that is based on gratings that are index-matched to a sublayer thereby avoiding localized, particle-type resonances. This attribute imbues the components with tolerance to parametric deviations essential for practical manufacturing. The new physics is based on lateral leaky Bloch modes and attendant lattice resonance. It is different from the interference-based physics of classic thin-film optics. Therefore, a new dimension in functionality with high levels of spectral diversity and control is brought into the optical component arena supporting many societally valuable applications. In Phase I, relevant fabrication processes will be developed to show the potential for scale-up to mass production. The effort delivers three main high performance component types (reflectors, filters, and polarizers) that meet stringent specifications in terms of efficiency and bandwidth._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The demonstration of fusion ignition at the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in December 2022 is a key milestone towards the implementation of Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) as an inexhaustible source of clean energy. This remarkable achievement sets a path to fusion power plants in which new high repetition rate IFE laser drivers will be needed to make laser fusion practical. Different IFE driver architectures could be used for laser fusion. However, in all of these systems the ability to operate at high energy, with high average power (high repetition rate) over multi-giga-shots exposure is in part limited by the damage of coatings in critical beam transport and focusing optics. How we propose to address the problem\/ situation in Phase I: XUV Lasers Inc. in collaboration with Colorado State University proposes to address the scaling in the laser damage resistance of coatings for an operational wavelength ? =355 nm; nominal pulse duration &lt;10 nsec, through an investigation of novel amorphous oxide materials for transmissive and reflective coatings. The innovative aspects of the proposed research will be: i) in the use of amorphous oxide mixtures and nanolaminate structures deposited by sputtering which will substitute the more-prone to damage layers in the coating; and ii) in tailoring the substrate\/coating interface, which plays a critical role in the coatings\u2019 adhesion and laser damage, to enhance their lifetime. Experiments to test laser damage resistance at ? = 355 nm, with a pulse duration of ~10 ns, and over multi-shot exposure will allow us to identify the most promising coating materials and coating architectures. Commercial applications and other benefits: The knowledge developed through this project will impact the engineering of interference coatings based on amorphous oxides for applications in IFE lasers in particular and broadly for high intensity lasers being used in large and medium frame DoE laser facilities."

        "Abstract": "In order to accelerate widespread electric vehicle adoption, improving battery energy densities, charge rates, manufacturing costs, and safety is imperative. Herein, we propose a scalable manufacturing process to improve LIB cell design using 3-D electrode architectures which will minimize inactive material (30% decrease) leading to a 15% increase in cell energy density (330 Wh\/kg) and a 10% decrease in cell cost ($82\/kWh) while simultaneously improving safety by eliminating Li-plating. The 3-D architectures enable the use of high areal loading graphite (Gr) and graphite\/silicon blend (Gr\/Si) electrodes (5-8 mAh\/cm2) by enabling improved mass transport of Li-ions into the depth of the electrode. This allows for safe and fast charging of thick electrodes at relevant C-rates (2C) without Li plating. The goal for this Phase I SBIR\/STTR project is three-fold: (1) Demonstrate a laser ablation process to generate 3-D structures in 7-8 mAh\/cm2 Gr and Gr\/Si electrodes using commercial IR lasers compatible with high throughput, low-cost manufacturing; (2) Perform a design-of-experiments using single-layer pouch cells with various 3-D geometries to optimize energy density and charge rate, ensuring compatibility with high throughput manufacturing; and (3) Manufacture and test multilayer pouch cells (&gt;2 Ah) using the optimized geometry to demonstrate a 30% reduction in inactive materials and increased safety by showing the elimination of Li-plating. The proposed laser manufacturing processes is drop-in compatible with today\u2019s LIB manufacturing and can be directly integrated into high-speed roll-to-roll electrode manufacturing lines, such as those being built in LIB \u201cgigafactories\u201d currently being built across the United States. As a result, the CapEx investments are significantly reduced, enabling us to scale rapidly at a low cost, while simultaneously leveraging the already extensive investments in and optimization of LIB manufacturing. This contrasts with next-generation battery chemistries such as Li-metal anodes or solid-state batteries which require a redesign of the manufacturing process and will massive investments in time and resources to scale to be cost competitive with LIBs."

        "Abstract": "This project addresses the needs outlined in Section C56-35 of the Topics for FY 2023 Phase I,\nRelease 2 DoE SBIR\/STTR and more specifically the lasers of Type III and IV listed in the table\nshown in this section. Over the past decade, a growing number of applications have emerged that\nrequire stable, high energy and high repetition rate 2 \u00b5m wavelength lasers either for direct use or\nto drive secondary sources either into the mid-IR or the soft X-ray. Long-wavelength ultrafast\nlasers have been identified as promising drivers for the acceleration of proton or light ions with\napplications for highly targeted cancer therapy.\nLaser systems with energies in the multi-mJ, multi-kHz parameter range at 2 \u00b5m wavelength\nhave also been identified as ideal sources to produce coherent soft X-ray radiation into the waterwindow\nvia high harmonic generation (HHG). This soft-X-ray radiation find applications in the\nstudy of novel quantum materials or for the inspection of Si wafers in semi-conductor fabs.\nOver the past decade, there have been efforts to develop 2 \u00b5m wavelength lasers as well as all\nnecessary components in this spectral region. These efforts have mainly followed three\norientations: (i) ultrafast, mJ, hundreds of kHz Tm-doped fiber lasers, (ii) ultrafast, kHz, mJ-level\nCr2+:chalcogenide solid-state lasers and (iii) few-ps, kHz, tens of mJ Ho-doped solid-state lasers.\nDespite these efforts, the maturity of 2 \u00b5m ultrafast lasers still lags behind that of 1 \u00b5m systems.\nIn particular, there is currently no clear pathway to scale ultrashort (sub-ps), 2 \u00b5m wavelength\npulses to the hundreds of mJ at tens to hundreds of Hz and higher repetition rates.\nIn this work, we propose to investigate the spectroscopic and thermo-optic properties of\nHo:CALGO, Ho:CaF2, and engineered Ho:YLF and assess their suitability for the direct\namplification of optical pulses to the tens to hundreds of mJ at sub-ps duration and investigate\nrepetition rate limitations at these energy levels. CALGO and CaF2, when doped with Yb-ions\nhave successfully enabled the simultaneous amplification of high energy and broadband pulses.\nWhile the literature is scarce on the topic \u2013 the few papers that have investigated the spectroscopic\nproperties of Ho:CALGO and Ho:CaF2 do show promise in their potential to amplify ultrashort\npulses to high energies.\nThe Phase I of this project will be focused on studying the feasibility of a laser amplifier that would\ndirectly deliver tens to hundreds of mJ pulses with duration ideally in the sub-300 fs duration\nregime. The Phase II of the project would be focused on designing and constructing such laser\nsystem, building upon DoE funded work at KMLabs that has already been productive ."

        "Abstract": "Water reservoirs often produce methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. With more reservoirs being constructed to produce electricity, it is important to determine how much methane gas reservoirs emit into the atmosphere. The eddy covariance devices that are frequently used to measure the quantity of methane gas that reservoirs produce are severely limited in the number of locations where they can make methane measurements. This technology will use laser beams to make methane measurements in locations where eddy covariance devices cannot be placed. The technology can measure methane concentration, wind speed, and turbulence in a chosen small volume of air. The technology is based on a new method for measuring wind and turbulence in a specific remote location. There are two main objectives for Phase I: (1) demonstrate that the new methane-sensing method can accurately measure methane concentrations and wind speed, and (2) develop a preliminary Phase II prototype design with down-selection of key system components. The optical and signal processing methods that this new methane sensing technique relies on will be tested. The Phase I study will allow evaluation of system performance in methane concentration and wind velocity measurement. This technology can be adopted in a wide range of applications in industry, research, and the military. This technology will be able to detect methane that is leaking out of pipes and storage tanks. The detection can be done from a safe distance. The wind measurement capability of the proposed instrument will make the tracking of methane plumes faster and easier. This technology can be modified to detect other molecules, including hazardous ones, by using different laser wavelengths. Wind farm operators could use this laser-based wind sensor technology to evaluate potential wind farm sites and make existing wind farms more efficient. This technology will also provide data that can assist in the effort to quantify the effects of greenhouse gases such as methane on the Earth\u2019s climate. In military applications, this technology can be used to detect and track chemical and biological agents in the air."

        "Abstract": "Beam combining of many ultrafast lasers is a very promising route to achieving high peak power and high average power laser systems required for DOE acceleration applications. Fiber lasers have become key workhorses for power scaling of ultrafast laser sources due to their high single-pass gain, outstanding heat-dissipating capability, excellent beam quality, inherent simplicity, and compactness. However, due to the long interaction length and small core size of a conventional silica fiber amplifier, there will be a large amount of accumulated nonlinearity distorting the ultrashort pulses, both in the temporal and spectral domains. Rod-type photonic crystal silica fibers have been mainly used for high-power ultrafast laser amplifiers with mitigated nonlinear effects due to their large mode field areas. However, the high cost of rod-type photonic crystal fibers and the need for free space coupling severely restrict their use in beam combining of many ultrafast lasers. NP Photonics proposes to develop compact and robust shortlength all-fiber amplifier arrays that are suitable for ultrafast fiber laser beam combining with low nonlinearity and significantly reduced cost by taking advantage of our unique highly doped phosphate fiber laser technology. NP Photonics\u2019 highly doped phosphate fibers have already shown the unique advantage for ultrashort pulse amplification with ultra-low nonlinearity because they have absorptions ten times larger than conventional silica fibers and can be made with very large single-mode cores using our proprietary rod-in-tube technique. In the Phase I program, we will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed 1-W pencil amplifier and 100-watt-level largemode-area fiber amplifier for ultrafast laser amplification and coherent combination. Short-length Yb-doped fiber amplifier arrays for laser beam combining will be developed and delivered to DOE laboratory for test in Phase II. Our proposed short-length fiber laser amplifiers can be used to achieve high peak and average power mode-locked and Q-switched laser sources that have found applications in many other fields such as advanced material processing, medical applications, spectroscopy, remote sensing, and Lidar."

        "Abstract": "Rare Earth Elements are critical metals that have significant military and civilian uses, including laser targeting systems, electronics, magnets, medical imaging, fiber optics, batteries, and many other applications. These metals are exceptionally difficult to separate from each other because of their chemical similarities. This project will develop faster and less expensive methods to separate these metals.This project will develop new ion exchange resins with exceptional chemical selectivity. These resins will allow individual rare earth elements to be extracted from complex mixtures containing multiple rare earth elements and other difficult to separate metals. These highly efficient resins will function as drop-in replacements for the less efficient ion exchange resins that are currently used.In Phase I, a set of 500,000 resins will be tested for their ability to selectively separate rare earth elements from a complex mixture of metals with minimal or no chemical modifications. Resins will be tested for their ability to extract exceptionally trace levels of rare earth elements. The selectivity, speed, and minimum usable concentrations for the resins will be determined.This project will deliver novel highly selective ion exchange resins to separate individual rare earth elements. For example, the proposed resins work directly with metal source streams such as acid mine leachate, and therefore can eliminate the need for expensive mining chemicals, which comprise 60% of the operating costs of extraction facilities. Fast and high-purity separations are needed to supply a wide set of US government and private sector requirements for these metals. In order to expedite commercial use of the proposed resin technology, the proposed new high efficiency resins are designed to function with the current separation and refinement infrastructure."

        "Abstract": "Rare earth elements play a crucial role in the modern economy; these materials are essential for many industrial applications including medical imaging, personal electronic devices, optical displays, lasers, and magnets. Rare earth elements are attractive raw materials for modern industries due to their distinct electronic properties, but their nearly indistinct chemical properties make them very difficult to separate from one another. The global supply of rare earth elements is dominated by Chinese production, which presents global supply-chain and supply-security issues, and areas around the most productive rare earth element mines are notorious for high levels of pollution. As global demand for rare earth elements increases, a need for decentralization of their production and an opportunity for establishment of more sustainable production and separation processes are apparent. Covalently functionalized crosslinked polymers are a promising class of materials for rare earth element separations. These materials are a natural marriage between molecular rare earth element extractants and ion-exchange resins. We will employ thiol-ene Click Chemistry for polymer functionalization; this chemistry is orthogonal to a wide range of functional groups, making it a powerful platform for materials discovery. The robust covalent ether thiol linkage between the polymeric backbone and the functional group should facilitate minimal leeching of the metal-binding functional group even under very harsh separation conditions (harsh organic solvents, acidic aqueous environments, etc.). In this Phase I project, discovery of materials for rare earth interelement separations will occur through the following four objectives: \u2022 Develop high-throughput analytical procedures for evaluating rare earth element separations, enabling low detection limits for assessing challenging separations \u2022 Prepare a library of targeted and exploratory covalently functionalized polymeric resins \u2022 Screen library of functionalized resins to identify structure-to-function properties and topperforming materials \u2022 Define commercialization path for top performing candidates Phase I of this project will establish key works flows for analysis of rare earth element separation performance. This, coupled with a significant material discovery effort, will enable commercialization strategies to be developed for top-performing resins. Structure-to-function trends will be identified to inform the design and synthesis of resins in future phases of this project. We expect that subtle changes in the functional group composition will be required to achieve optimal separation performance between the chemically indistinct rare earth elements."

Photodetectors made of many single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) firing in Geiger mode are widely valued for their single-photon sensitivity and picosecond timing resolution. Some of the advantages of SPADs are low cost, robust construction, excellent response time, compactness, improved life span, lower power consumption, lower operating voltages, and immunity to magnetic fields. That said, new applications are pushing to increase the spatial resolution and decrease the size of the device while maintaining or increasing photon detection efficiency. This proposal addresses these challenges by exploring a new class of SPADs that exploit Mie resonance to increase photon detection efficiency in smaller pixels with the goal of enhancing spatial resolution in low-light applications that require a small footprint. Phase I employs simulation and experimental work to develop a silicon SPAD design and fabrication process flow, that begins to address crucial questions arising from implementing the larger reverse voltages in nanosize devices."

        "Abstract": "Focused ion beams (FIBs) employing a plasma ion source are employed in research and industrial applications, including nanotechnology, biotechnology, semiconductor manufacture, and energy exploration. Noble gas ion beams of argon, krypton, and xenon are of particular importance in preparation of samples for high-precision microscopy. Today\u2019s noble gas ion sources excel at preparation of these samples because of their inert nature, and because they can rapidly remove of large quantities of material. Despite these benefit of noble gas ion beams, the current generation of plasma FIBs are not typically used in important high-resolution nanomachining tasks, like circuit edit for semiconductor devices, because they lack the ability to be focused tightly for milling fine features. In this SBIR project, a new source of noble-gas ions will be developed that addresses limitations in today\u2019s commercially available plasma FIBs. This ion source will increase the precision of these instruments by 10x by reducing the focal spot size of the beam. It will retain all of the advantages of existing plasma ion sources, such as high material removal rates. The new ion source technology works by photoionizing laser-cooled atoms to create a bright beam that can be focused to a few-nm in size. The aim of Phase I research and development is to design, build, and test a prototype Ar+ noble gas ion source appropriate for future use in FIB instruments. The research will focus on producing high-brightness beams with a currents up to several nano-Amperes. Advances in the technology supported by these efforts will enable use of noble-gas ion beams in applications such as nanofabrication, and transmission electron microscopy, and atom probe tomography. The result of Phase I will be a working ion source prototype ready for integration with a FIB instrument in Phase II. After this integration is complete, FIB instruments including the new noble gas ion source will be ready for commercial deployment. These instruments will aid academic and commercial researchers in diverse set of fields such as biology, material science, radiometry, and semiconductor manufacture."

        "Abstract": "C56-18d-273148The portfolio of future energy solutions must consider increased hydrogen use, as it serves the critical need of being a carbon-free energy transport medium. However, hydrogen is highly flammable and is a potent indirect greenhouse gas. Hydrogen facilities that will enable socially- responsible use of this energy source therefore need to detect, quantify, and mitigate hydrogen emissions and leaks. Localizing and quantifying hydrogen emissions is currently impossible due to the absence of fast, sensitive, and specific hydrogen analyzers. This project will design, construct, and validate both a low-cost sensor for real-time hydrogen detection and develop methods to use the sensors to pinpoint industrial emissions. The project will couple our novel hydrogen conversion front end with a sensor that is much less expensive than our current ultra-high sensitivity instrument offering. The low-cost system will remain rapid (1 second or faster) but meet a lower cost point by moving to near-IR and fiber- coupled laser technology while retaining a sensitivity of 30 ppb or better. In parallel with the low-cost design and demonstration work, we will develop an analytical system to quantify facility- level emissions geared toward use by industry operators. We envision a robust modeling system that will continuously estimate emission magnitudes and locations, providing rapid, actionable feedback to operators to mitigate leaks that may otherwise go unnoticed. Success during Phase I relies upon completion of several tasks: i) refining an existing fiber-coupled near-IR absorption spectrometer design for longer pathlength; ii) construct and evaluate the benchtop absorption spectrometer coupled to a previously developed hydrogen conversion system; iii) develop and field test a source dispersion model that can be readily applied at facility fenceline for rapid determination of emission location and magnitude; and iv) design a prototype to be constructed during Phase II that integrates the hydrogen converter, network interface, and weatherproofing into a single unit. Aerodyne is committed to commercializing the resulting monitor and emissions detection system, making it widely usable by the energy industry. In Phase II we envision construction of a prototype monitor for initial deployment at a controlled release demonstration site and working with an industry partner to deploy a pilot system. During this period will seek to strengthen the collaborative aspects of the program by drawing on the expertise of our research partners: Cornell University, Colorado State University, NREL, and the Environmental Defense Fund."

        "Abstract": "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\u2019s (LLNL) National Ignition Facility (NIF) recently announced the achievement of fusion ignition for the first time, by delivering 2.05 MJ of energy to the target, resulting in 3.15 MJ of fusion energy output. Further power scaling of the system will require addressing a number of power-limiting technical issues. One such limitation is the anti-reflection coatings applied to transmissive optics in the high-energy lasers, which fundamentally exhibit both elevated absorption and defects that result in beam quality issues, and more critically, lifetime concerns. Developing commercially viable laser drivers for an internal fusion energy (IFE) powerplant will require engineered beam transport and focusing optical systems capable of operating robustly 24\/7 at high energy, high average power, and improved Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) in the multi-Gigashot Regime. TelAztec has developed a replacement technology for multilayer thin-film AR coatings, by plasma etching a random anti-reflection (RAR) nano-texture directly into the optical component. Greater than 99.9% transmission is routinely achieved over broad bandwidths, with low scatter and an absence of power and lifetime-limiting absorption and defects. In addition, RAR nano-textures have shown a 2\u20135x higher laser damage threshold than coatings for both CW and pulsed lasers, and long-term beam stability due an absence of material fatigue at the air\/optic interface. In the Phase I R&amp;D effort to further power scale high-energy laser systems, TelAztec will coordinate with LLNL, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), and the Texas Petawatt facility partners to refine a detailed series of experiments to isolate fundamental failure mechanisms with nano-textured fused silica optics. Fused silica bulk material issues such as sub-surface polishing damage (Beilby layer), polishing contamination, UV plasma degradation and nano-texture related characteristics such as surface contamination from plasma etching, nano-texture design, and electric field effects on the nano-texture will be among variables isolated. Photon backscatter measurements and pulsed laser damage testing at 355 nm will define the dominant factors in the onset of laser damage, and substrate polishing and\/or plasma etch process modifications will be brought into play to mitigate the issue(s) and enhance laser damage threshold. A second batch of nano-textured optics processed with damage mitigation processes to verify increased power handling, as quantified through a second round of characterization and pulsed laser damage testing. The results of the Phase I will demonstrate a surface treatment for improved beam transport and focusing optical systems capable of operating robustly and continuously at high energy, high average power, and MTTFs in the multi-Gigashot Regime\u2014addressing all of the aforementioned critical drivers for an IFE powerplant. On the commercial side, nano-textured optics are now being integrated into high-power industrial and medical lasers due to improved power handling, lifetime, beam stability, and operational cost. Further power scaling of these systems will enable higher efficiency manufacturing that will lead to significant energy savings and introduction to new markets. Finally, for NIF, potential improvement in reducing reflection losses and increasing optic lifetime may be a key to ultimately realizing economic fusion energy, a milestone towards green energy and a zero-emission future."

        "Abstract": "Based on the design of large aperture high energy laser technology developed at the national Ignition Facility (NIF), most planned IFE laser facilities need to operate at frequency converted shorter laser wavelengths. These future IFE driver lasers will have to operate at much higher average power and repetition rates than NIF while maintaining high wall plug efficiency. As compared to the current conversion crystal KDP, nonlinear crystal Lithium Tri-borate (LBO) has multiple times higher conversion efficiency, much wider angular acceptance and unparalleled Laser induced Damage Threshold (LiDT). To use LBO for these high energy Laser drivers would enable much more compact and efficient design and would save hundreds of millions of dollars in ignition IFE facilities. However, LBO is not currently available in aperture sizes large enough to be used in such high energy drivers. To grow single-crystalline LBO to large enough size is an extremely difficult, expensive, and lengthy process with myriads of risk factors leading to potentially catastrophic failure. Larger LBO boules also tend to be higher absorbing and less uniform than smaller LBO boules. An optically seamless and infinitely scalable process to increase the aperture of LBO crystals would have an enormous impact on the viability of laser driven fusion commercial energy production. Objective: To develop an optically seamless and infinitely scalable fabrication process to increase the optical aperture of LBOs used for Type I Second Harmonic Generation from IR to green. Tasks: To explore critical risk factors of diffusion bonding in various orientations of LBO. To multiply optical aperture in 2 dimensions to construct fundamental unit of a composite LBO. Measuring any optical distortion present in the composite as compared to monolithic single-crystalline LBO. High resolution testing of phase match and absorption uniformity of the composite as compared to monolithic single crystalline LBO. Commercial Applications: Historically, major technological advancements have been made possible by prerequisite advancements in materials. In the recent decades, various high energy laser facilities around the world have enabled breakthrough research in high energy density physics. Many of these facilities will make use of LBO for harmonic generation and optical parametric amplification. High energy free space communications and direct energy weapons are also looking for large aperture LBOs for frequency conversion of IR energy to the visible and UV spectrum. Inspired by the recent landmark event of achieving ignition at NIF, initiatives of future IFE power plant will make use of large aperture LBOs to realize highly efficient high repetition rate next generation laser drivers."

        "Abstract": "STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nStructure-based wakefield accelerators promise orders of magnitude improvements in accelerator gradient\nover conventional radiofrequency-based technologies, and have been identified as a candidate technology\nfor future applications ranging from compact free electron lasers to high energy colliders. However,\nachieving the desired peak energies and beam quality requires meter-scale structures with tighter tolerances,\nintroducing new constraints on structure and beam characteristics. Accurate simulations of these structures\nrequire tools with both greater sophistication and performance in order to realize these advances.\nGENERAL STATEMENT OF HOW THE PROBLEM IS BEING ADDRESSED\nWe propose to build on recent advances in numerical analysis and machine learning to develop novel\nsurrogate model implementations for capturing the wakefield response of arbitrary structures in conjunction\nwith self-consistent beam dynamics.

        "Abstract": "Printed electronics offer the potential to achieve low-energy consumption and integration of novel optoelectronic nanomaterials onto silicon wafers for manufacturing photonic integrated circuits (e.g., silicon photonics). However, there are limited choices in commercial semiconductor inks, and most of them do not apply to optoelectronic applications. In this Phase I project, Iris Light Technologies and Argonne National Lab (PI: Yuepeng Zheng) will overcome the electronic conductivity limitations of existing printed semiconductors to enable improved generation efficiency of on-chip light emitters. Improved ink synthesis and printing process reproducibility and yield will be demonstrated. The Phase I deliverables are: (1) an improved semiconductor ink with 20% larger conductivity, and (2) prototype LEDs emitting at the wavelength relevant to cloud data center communications, e.g. 1310 nm. Iris Light will lead the ink development, device design, and opto-electronic component characterization, while ANL will lead the printing technique and process advancement for precise ink deposition and patterning. In Phase 2, the team will integrate the prototype devices directly onto foundry chips to demonstrate foundry-compatible manufacturing of onchip embedded lasers and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). A major outcome of the program is the technology transition to a state-of-the-art 300 mm semiconductor foundry located within the US with a mission to grow domestic manufacturing capability for the silicon photonics market (AIM Photonics). Iris Light has worked with this foundry for over four years towards on-chip component development including gratings, optical filters, polarization control, photodetectors, and more. The advances achieved in this program will foster increased US manufacturing competitiveness in the emerging space of printable microelectronics and next-generation optoelectronic materials. Photonic chips (photonic integrated circuits - PICs) have gained significant traction for their high-performance and low-cost components in the optical communications industry (datacom\/telecom) valued at over $1 billion today and growing at 45% annually. The growth of cloud infrastructure has fueled demand for scalable, denser integration of onchip optics for pluggable optics that have reached bandwidths exceeding 100 Gb\/s. From an energy perspective, the data center market already accounts for ~2% of global emissions, 10% of electricity consumption, and is expanding at an unsustainable rate. The rise of high-performance computing (HPC) presents an additional challenge. In the Fall of 2021, Argonne National Lab (ANL) retired its third-generation petascale machine, Mira, with the announcement of transitioning to the exascale using a device called Aurora which consumes high levels of electricity (60 MW\/year), enough to power 42,000 homes. Increasing data transfer efficiency (more data per unit of energy) contributes to decarbonization and is complementary to efforts focused on shifting energy production to sustainable sources. Both approaches are vital to our function as a society in the long run. The efficiencies enabled by photonic chips are driving network bandwidths into the terabitper- second regime and simultaneously decreasing data energy cost per bit. Silicon photonics is already commercially deployed and poised to decrease the need for high-capacity cooling systems, a major driver in power consumption in data centers. While there has been immense progress in silicon photonics, the search for on-chip laser sources continues despite decades of research. To overcome the \u2018silicon laser problem\u2019, Iris Light Technologies is developing a new class of on-chip lasers based on photonic ink gain material printed on silicon wafers. These new on-chip lasers will not only drastically reduce the size of circuits, but also enable higher-bandwidth network interconnections between compute and memory nodes as required by energy-efficient disaggregated networks coming online."

        "Abstract": "In order to accelerate widespread electric vehicle adoption, improving battery energy densities, charge rates, manufacturing costs, and safety is imperative. Herein, we propose a scalable manufacturing process to improve LIB cell design using 3-D electrode architectures which will minimize inactive material (30% decrease) leading to a 15% increase in cell energy density (330 Wh\/kg) and a 10% decrease in cell cost ($82\/kWh) while simultaneously improving safety by eliminating Li-plating. The 3-D architectures enable the use of high areal loading graphite (Gr) and graphite\/silicon blend (Gr\/Si) electrodes (5-8 mAh\/cm2) by enabling improved mass transport of Li-ions into the depth of the electrode. This allows for safe and fast charging of thick electrodes at relevant C-rates (2C) without Li plating. The goal for this Phase I SBIR\/STTR project is three-fold: (1) Demonstrate a laser ablation process to generate 3-D structures in 7-8 mAh\/cm2 Gr and Gr\/Si electrodes using commercial IR lasers compatible with high throughput, low-cost manufacturing; (2) Perform a design-of-experiments using single-layer pouch cells with various 3-D geometries to optimize energy density and charge rate, ensuring compatibility with high throughput manufacturing; and (3) Manufacture and test multilayer pouch cells (&gt;2 Ah) using the optimized geometry to demonstrate a 30% reduction in inactive materials and increased safety by showing the elimination of Li-plating. The proposed laser manufacturing processes is drop-in compatible with today\u2019s LIB manufacturing and can be directly integrated into high-speed roll-to-roll electrode manufacturing lines, such as those being built in LIB \u201cgigafactories\u201d currently being built across the United States. As a result, the CapEx investments are significantly reduced, enabling us to scale rapidly at a low cost, while simultaneously leveraging the already extensive investments in and optimization of LIB manufacturing. This contrasts with next-generation battery chemistries such as Li-metal anodes or solid-state batteries which require a redesign of the manufacturing process and will massive investments in time and resources to scale to be cost competitive with LIBs."

Beryllium is a known human carcinogen and can lead to berylliosis or chronic beryllium disease. Present laboratory-based analytical technologies for measuring beryllium contamination do not provide real-time analysis required to effectively protect workers at DOE D&amp;D sites. Show proof that a LIBS (Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy) instrument can be developed for real-time beryllium measurements by EH&amp;S personnel with the same level of confidence that exists with the current laboratory analysis. The practical aspects of having a real time analysis capability is one of the most significant advantages of this approach allowing the EH&amp;S personnel to run the analyses according to the current field work priorities. Demonstrate that an advanced LIBS instrument with can satisfy the requirements for beryllium analysis to support DOE D&amp;D activities. Work with ORNL and UCOR to establish instrument sensitivity that meets the current 0.2 microgram\/100cm2 regulation and establish sampling methodology for confidence when directly sampling swipes. Investigate new sampling protocol as alternative to ghost wipes. Phase I will demonstrate that the technology is suitable for screening (provide a Go\/No-Go identifier for the presence of Be with respect to the regulation level) and Phase II, will establish metrics for quantitative analysis of beryllium on the swipes and validation. A field LIBS instrument that can be operated by trained EH&amp;D personnel will eliminate the bottleneck of laboratory beryllium analysis ensuring safety for facility personnel, increase analysis throughput, decrease cost per sample, and expedite D&amp;D activities. Such an instrument will serve the greater Be hazards analysis community by addressing the BHSC (Beryllium Health &amp; Safety Commission) and OSHA (Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration) requirements for all sites containing Be. The technology\/instrument will measure other hazards related to decommissioning and environmental contamination, critical materials, and facility contamination during advanced manufacturing. As the USA ramps up mining, processing and manufacturing, real-time measurements will be needed to ensure environmental and worker safety."

        "Abstract": "Significant progress in nuclear fusion reactions has been reported by a national laser fusion laboratory achieving nuclear fusion ignition. Ignition is the long sought answer for providing large amounts of clean energy by producing more energy output than what was used to initiate the controlled fusion process. The technology to add nuclear fusion to provide power to the grid, called inertial fusion energy, has not been developed at the same pace, with a lack of high-power optics able to support the high-power laser systems required to reach ignition. An emerging electro-optic technology that can support high-energy high-power lasers is the Plasma Electrode Pockels Cell. This cell has been demonstrated as a means to reduce the size and cost of high-power laser systems, while supporting larger aperture lasers that standard Pockels cells cannot. This new technology can also support higher repetition rates which is critical for transitioning ignition from the infrequent mode of operation at national facilities to several hertz of operation in power plants on the grid. In this Phase I effort, the technology transfer of the Plasma Electrode Pockels Cell will be conducted, and a conceptual design of a commercially available model will be developed. The potential user market will be polled to identify future performance required to support this emerging market for Inertial Fusion Energy. A product road map and commercialization plan will also be developed that can be built upon in a follow-on Phase II program. The electro-optic Plassma Electrode Pockels Cell technology is a direct enabler of high-power high-energy modular lasers that can be deployed to achieve Inertial Fusion Energy in next generation power plants serving as a source of clean energy. This technology can support the growing number of start-ups pursuing Inertial Fusion Energy, as well as existing laser companies providing high-power lasers to national facilities and businesses."

        "Abstract": "Advanced energy applications may use molten salt for nuclear reactors. Molten Salt Reactors operate under extreme environmental conditions that require equally extreme methods for salt characterization and monitoring. Unfortunately, current sensor technology is not well suited to the high-temperature, corrosive, and irradiated environment of a Molten Salt Reactor.To address the issues, a laser-based technique that combines spatial domain thermo-emission with a photothermal membrane resonator will be developed that can measure density, viscosity, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity. These are critical values that must be known for future Molten Salt Reactors. The sensor will serve as a new diagnostic to better understand the nature of molten salts, guide future molten salt reactor designs, and respond to the needs of the burgeoning MSR industry.During Phase I, a prototype sensor will be developed and tested in a molten salt environment to demonstrate the feasibility of the sensor. This will include first building and calibrating the sensor. The sensor will then finally be demonstrated in a molten salt environment.Efforts to develop and commercialize advanced nuclear reactors and Molten Salt Reactor technology has grown substantially in the past decade, with stakeholders represented in private industry and commitments made through public policy (e.g., the DOE). The potential benefits of high temperature Molten Salt Reactors include greater thermal-to-electric efficiency, greater consumption of nuclear material\/waste (i.e., closing the fuel cycle), better economics through passive safety, and a re-branding of nuclear energy that can generate newfound support from US citizens. Additionally, the high temperature operation of Molten Salt Reactors opens the door to the other 2\/3 of the energy market including desalination, synthetic fuel and hydrogen production, and high temperature process heat. Other benefits of Molten Salt Reactor deployment include reliable carbon-free power generation with a compact environmental footprint that consumes substantially fewer material resources than many other power sources. The proposed sensor is enabling technology for the Molten Salt Reactors."

        "Abstract": "There is a growing need to detect lithium and its build-up in the environment, given its widespread use in lithium-ion batteries and potential use in thermonuclear weapons. Improper disposal of lithium-ion batteries may lead to difficult-to-contain fires and contamination of soil and groundwater. Lithium-6 isotope may also be used in thermonuclear weapons as it can be used to produce tritium. However, lithium has to be enriched to 40-95% from its natural abundance of 4.85-7.59%. Significant increases in the Li-6 isotope in the environment will be a good indicator that clandestine enrichment of lithium has taken place. At present, soil samples are collected and then sent to laboratories for analysis using large and expensive equipment, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers (ICP-MS) or secondary-ion mass spectrometers (SIMS). This can take weeks to obtain results, and utmost care must be taken to ensure the integrity of the sample. Optical techniques, such as laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and tunable diode laser absorption (TDLAS), show potential as viable field detectors for nuclear materials. However, field LIBS instruments suffer from poor spectral resolution to detect isotopic shifts of nuclear materials.To overcome these limitations, we propose a compact optical spectroscopy instrument for the environmental detection and isotopic ratio analysis of lithium. In recent work we have demonstrated the feasibility of this LA-TDLAS approach by identifying and resolving isotopic and ground state hyperfine splitting in rubidium as well as in uranium. In this Phase I effort, we will extend this capability to detect lithium and its isotopes and demonstrate its feasibility for portable system. This will lead to the development of a prototype instrument in Phase II.The proposed technology uses an innovative atomic absorption spectroscopy for the environmental detection and isotopic ratio analysis of lithium. Our technology will also be much more compact than mass spectrometer and higher resolving power than currently available optical spectroscopy systems, allowing our technology to be more suitable for field applications and in challenging environments. The proposed technology will also benefit the analytical chemistry community and nuclear energy community."

        "Abstract": "Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that is emitted by many industrial and agricultural processes. More specifically, as a byproduct of the oil and gas industry, methane is often flared in order to prevent its release into the environment. However, incomplete combustion and flameouts can lead to methane emissions. Early and reliable detection of these leaks is crucial to prevent harm to both human health and to the environment as well as to support the Federal government in achieving a \u201cnet-zero\u201d carbon economy by 2050. In order to detect flare methane emissions, we propose to construct a laser-based spectrometer that relies on the highly sensitivity technique of dual frequency comb spectroscopy. With this technique, a laser beam with high spatial and temporal coherence is used to probe an environmental path anywhere from a few centimeters to multiple kilometers in length. The spectrum of the laser output will be absorbed by the unique molecular fingerprint of the sample path. Analyzing the absorbed frequencies and the magnitude of the absorption enables the precise determination of the trace gases and concentrations of interest. In this Phase I effort, we will determine the ideal wavelength range that the frequency comb output needs to cover in order to reliably detect the trace gases of interest. We will conduct trade studies to evaluate pathways to reduce the size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-C) of current methane sensing spectrometers, a necessary and important step to facilitate widespread adoption and field deployability. We will then construct a complete, robust and compact dual frequency comb spectrometer system capable of detecting methane and other volatile gases. In a laboratory setting, we will flare methane gas using burners designed to vary the flare efficiency and measure trace species concentrations directly through the flame using the spectrometer system. Field studies on operational oil and gas facilities will be addressed in a Phase II project phase in which we plan to deploy the spectrometers, algorithms, and direct flare monitoring hardware. Our Phase II partner LongPath Technologies will further incorporate the algorithms to populate its real time data dashboard and alerting system for direct customer use."

        "Abstract": "The development of superconducting undulators (SCU) that can stably operate at shorter periods and higher peak fields require designs with smaller gaps. These smaller gaps devices can be subjected to higher heat loads due to increased sensitivity to resistive wall impedances, beam losses, geometric impedance contributions and synchrotron radiation heating. Consequently, short period SCUs should ideally be designed to operate at higher temperatures where the cryo-cooling capacities are larger. Most SCUs developed to date utilize NbTi superconducting wire, which can only be operated at the liquid helium temperatures (&lt; 4.2 K), and thus are very sensitive to the warm core effects. MgB2 is a metallic superconductor with a transition temperature of around 39 K, significantly higher than NbTi or even Nb3Sn. The material also does not suffer from an unstable superconducting state at large currents or fields. Recent progress in the development of the 2nd generation MgB2 with much increased critical current, makes this material a promising new contender for the SCU applications. If one can develop a MgB2 SCU operating at ~12 K, Gifford-McMahon cryocoolers can be used which are less expensive, and offer superior cooling capacity compared to their liquid helium counterparts operating below 4.2 K. Phase I of this project entailed the design, simulation and cryogenic system engineering of the SCU prototype device that will utilize MgB2 wire, along with the construction of a sample wound module to gain familiarity with the manufacturing and validation needs. The final phase I undulator operating point was designed to be cryogen free and have a period of 15 mm, with an in wire current density Je of ~800A\/mm^2, operate at 10K in a self-field of 1.85T and a pole gap of 5 mm to generate a 1.14T axial field resulting in a k=1.6. Further as we are wire vendor agnostic, as the wire material development is progressing rapidly, we can nimbly adjust our design based on the best offering available during potential Phase II execution. If successfully demonstrated, these new type of SCU insertion devices can become a successful product, entertaining a considerable and continuous demand at the Synchrotron Light Source and X-ray Free Electron Laser facilities as it would permit the construction of a device that may not require a continuous LHe supply from the very beginning. This would enable to start implementation and testing of such an SCU locally at one beamline location, without the major upfront cost of developing a facility-wide cryogenic infrastructure and thus well worth the investment. Further, this device could significantly extend towards hard x rays the spectral range covered by undulators in the medium and high energy synchrotron light source facilities."

        "Abstract": "STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM High-quality beam transport through wakefield acceleration schemes, such as plasma or structure-based, requires careful characterization of the transverse beam centroid position. The centroid position is particularly important as drive-witness centroid mismatches yield emittance growth compromising beam quality. Further, beam characterization at high power and high intensity requires non-invasive, shottagged measurements to stabilize beam quality through the interaction. TECHNICAL APPROACH A novel diagnostic based on the well-established electro-optic sampling (EOS) technique is adaptable for non-interceptive position monitoring for high power beams. The electric fields that accompany relativistic, ultrashort bunches are used to diagnose both the beam bunch length and the time-of-arrival on a shot-to-shot basis. In EOS, the electric field near a birefringent crystal induces a change in polarizability, which is probed by a low-energy laser pulse. The measured response yields critical information on the beam temporal qualities. However, since the measured signal depends on the distance of the beam from the crystal surface, a multi-line EOS system laid out symmetrically about the beam centerline, can provide information on the position of the beam by analyzing the relative signal intensity on parallel arms of the system, which is the EOS-BPM configuration proposed herein. PHASE I PLANS The Phase I project aims to design a full three-dimensional version of the EOS-BPM. Preliminary experiments to test the proof-of-principle at the SLAC FACET-II facility are underway, under the leadership of University of Colorado Boulder. The team will participate in these experiments to gain firsthand operational experience on the diagnostic capability and data acquisition and interpretation. In parallel, engineering improvements will be applied, for the current version as well as forward-looking to the full three-dimensional version. These improvements include the development of pre-mounted, swappable crystals for rapid deployment in case of damage, or for parameter studies, schemes for independent control of laser alignment mirrors and crystal, and development of high-extinction ratio polarizers. The improvements will lay a foundation for Phase II, where a full 3-dimensional unit will be developed in a user-friendly package integrable into accelerator facilities. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS The program results will yield a compact beam position monitor that can be used for high power and high intensity beams, and as an added feature, can also relay the beam longitudinal profile simultaneously. The utility of the device extends from high energy physics machines to light sources and synchrotrons."

        "Abstract": "STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM High-quality beam transport through wakefield acceleration schemes, such as plasma or structure-based, requires careful characterization of the transverse beam centroid position. The centroid position is particularly important as drive-witness centroid mismatches yield emittance growth compromising beam quality. Further, beam characterization at high power and high intensity requires non-invasive, shottagged measurements to stabilize beam quality through the interaction. TECHNICAL APPROACH A novel diagnostic based on the well-established electro-optic sampling (EOS) technique is adaptable for non-interceptive position monitoring for high power beams. The electric fields that accompany relativistic, ultrashort bunches are used to diagnose both the beam bunch length and the time-of-arrival on a shot-to-shot basis. In EOS, the electric field near a birefringent crystal induces a change in polarizability, which is probed by a low-energy laser pulse. The measured response yields critical information on the beam temporal qualities. However, since the measured signal depends on the distance of the beam from the crystal surface, a multi-line EOS system laid out symmetrically about the beam centerline, can provide information on the position of the beam by analyzing the relative signal intensity on parallel arms of the system, which is the EOS-BPM configuration proposed herein. PHASE I PLANS The Phase I project aims to design a full three-dimensional version of the EOS-BPM. Preliminary experiments to test the proof-of-principle at the SLAC FACET-II facility are underway, under the leadership of University of Colorado Boulder. The team will participate in these experiments to gain firsthand operational experience on the diagnostic capability and data acquisition and interpretation. In parallel, engineering improvements will be applied, for the current version as well as forward-looking to the full three-dimensional version. These improvements include the development of pre-mounted, swappable crystals for rapid deployment in case of damage, or for parameter studies, schemes for independent control of laser alignment mirrors and crystal, and development of high-extinction ratio polarizers. The improvements will lay a foundation for Phase II, where a full 3-dimensional unit will be developed in a user-friendly package integrable into accelerator facilities. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS The program results will yield a compact beam position monitor that can be used for high power and high intensity beams, and as an added feature, can also relay the beam longitudinal profile simultaneously. The utility of the device extends from high energy physics machines to light sources and synchrotrons."

        "Abstract": "Efficiently vitrifying slurries, such as is stored in wells at nuclear waste sites, into a solid glass for safe stabilization and storage requires accurately measuring its chemical composition. Current measurement methods are slow and labor-intensive, and are not checked for radioactive exposure. The slurry must be sampled for transport to a laboratory while it is filtered, tested, and analyzed. While Raman spectroscopy has shown promise for automating such measurements, its use has been limited to clear liquids, as it is not accurate in the turbid slurry that is typical of nuclear waste.\nStatement of how this problem is being addressed.\nAn innovative method is proposed for total internal reflection dual-wavelength Raman spectroscopy, with spectral normalization for turbidity so that it is accurate for a turbid slurry. The slurry is passed through a flow cell equipped with a Raman probe connected by fiber optic cables to a remote laser and spectrometer. This flow cell lends itself to use in an in situ low-maintenance Raman analyzer system that can run unattended for extended periods, continuously measuring and recording chemical concentrations\nWhat is to be done in Phase I?\nThe proposer has already demonstrated that total internal reflection Raman spectroscopy can be used to quantify chemical concentration in turbid solutions over certain chemical concentration ranges. The recorded signal was shown to be independent of temperature and turbidity level, achieved through spectral normalization.\nIn Phase I, the proposer will build on their previous Raman spectroscopy work by further developing the spectral normalization procedure, and by dual-wavelength compensation to suppress the broad Raman background, to improve reproducibility, accuracy, precision, and sensitivity over wider ranges of turbidity and chemical concentration.\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits\nThe proposed automated low-maintenance system with the capability to test turbid nuclear waste for chemical content in situ will greatly reduce costs and increase the safety of storing and processing the waste, and will reduce the chances of it leaking into the environment. The same benefits can be realized for other wastewater treatment, as already confirmed by end users in the wastewater treatment industry, where the chemical content of influent wastewater must be monitored to detect and address root causes of irregular release of toxic chemicals into the environment. The need for rapid testing of nuclear and other wastewater content becomes particularly important in emergencies such as flooding, earthquake, and accidents."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a fundamental change in the way spacecraft propulsion can be achieved, perhaps leading to orders of magnitude faster space travel. Recent physics breakthroughs suggest that the development of an electromagnetically powered engine could enable high-speed travel under the right conditions. Commercially, there is great potential to decrease transit time to destinations on earth, to low-earth orbit, to the moon, and to destinations further in our solar system.Success in developing this engine will initially be developed by improving satellite positioning and accessing orbits. Further scale up of this propulsion system could serve as a platform technology to enable increased access to space due to reduced need for chemical propellant and enhanced speeds._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis SBIR Phase I project develops and tests a prototype engine by verifying the creation of electromagnetically driven propulsion. By utilizing a complex dielectric material as the environment where electromagnetic energy is introduced, the proof-of-concept engine will verify that the weak and strong force conditions are not violated and that a positive energy density can initiate nanoscopic distortions, to demonstrate novel electromagnetic propulsion in the form of further scalable engines.A number of researchers have begun building upon the work of Albert Einstein\u2019s general relativity theory and now Miguel Alcubierre\u2019s metric that suggests that a vessel can be propelled by selective distortion. Two key goals are the development and implementation of the complex dielectric material, and the determinization of the radio frequency power required to achieve sufficient propulsion. The project approach will include: (a) mathematical modeling, (b) comprehensive simulations of different embodiments of the approach, (c) experimental verification of nanoscopic distortions using an established laser interferometry approach, and (d) design and testing of the prototype propulsion engine. Beyond the initial prototype, the next stages include an optimization of the power\/distortion metrics, association of the distortion to thrust, and maximization of the thrust to weight ratio.Ultimately, this research is expected to lead to enhanced electric propulsion that will be applicable initially to satellites, but ultimately, to a wide range of on earth and off planet propulsion._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "C55-09a-270378Time-resolved circular dichroism spectroscopy has increasingly been used to probe the dynamic spin states of advanced materials like metal-halide perovskites and spintronic semiconductors. Conventional spectroscopic techniques, however, average thousands of non-sequential left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized spectra together before generating a circular dichroism spectrum, leading to long acquisition times and significant baseline drift in time-resolved experiments. These drawbacks limit the accessibility of time-resolved circular dichroism spectroscopy, and hampers efforts to develop new diagnostic platforms for the advancement of next-generation energy and communication technology. In this proposal, PSI proposes the modeling, design, and validation of a transient-grating, time-resolved circular dichroism module for background-free, wavelength-agnostic investigations of material chirality. This approach uses two, cross-polarized laser pulses to induce a transient grating in sample that deflects a third probe pulse if, and only if, the sample has a circular dichroism response at that wavelength. The lack of any electro- optical devices or bandwidth limiting optics in the transient grating approach allows for a versatile spectrometer aimed at making time-resolved circular dichroism an accessible diagnostic technique for next-generation material characterization. The Phase I program will involve the development of an instrument model, the initial optical design of the transient grating spectrometer, a validation experiment, and the design of a prototype module. The commercial application of the transient-grating, time-resolved circular dichroism model stems from the technique\u2019s continued application in measuring the complicated spin-dynamics of advanced material systems. The module will be made versatile enough that continued development beyond Phase II will result in a general platform for four-wave mixing techniques with diagnostic capabilities for these novel materials. A suitably general spectrometer has the ability to provide a significant characterization advance for materials used in next-generation energy and communication technology."

        "Abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will address the widespread industry challenge of improving yield in compound semiconductor device production. Compound semiconductors with a wide bandgap are needed for high power devices in electric vehicles (EVs), high frequency components in 5G electronics, and energy-efficient displays. The compound semiconductor market, valued at $36+ billion in 2022, has increased recently with growing consumer demand for EVs.The annual growth rate of silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors, the most prominent devices, is estimated at over 20%. Despite the wide-scale production of these components in an industry that expects near perfection in manufacturing, the current yield of power electronic components is less than 50%. Poor yield results largely from an inability to adequately inspect substrates and epitaxial wafers used for power electronics. Instead, the industry currently relies on inspection tools with poor defect selectivity or destructive methods that can only provide statistical information about the defects in a wafer batch. To increase wafer yield, the team will develop a new type of optical inspection tool for selectively measuring defects in every wafer. If successful, this novel inspection technology will enable the industry to help drive down costs and increase performance of energy-efficient power electronics._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the novel way in which technology developed for use in fundamental science is being applied to rapid semiconductor inspection. The proposed method, called ultrafast imaging, uses the nonlinear optical response of a semiconductor induced by an ultrafast laser to isolate defects that measurably impact the electronic structure of the semiconductor. Though the semiconductor industry has typically focused on measuring morphology to find defects, measurement of compound semiconductors requires a tool that is sensitive to the electronic structure. This project will validate ultrafast imaging through benchmark testing against industry standards and develop an easy-to-use device for getting this technology into the hands of manufacturers. Partner manufacturing and inspection companies will provide inspection data and corresponding wafers, allowing correlation of ultrafast imaging defect measurements with data provided by other industry tools. Additionally, the team will develop and demonstrate an easy-to-use commercial product for user facilities and industrial research and development facilities, another essential step in the development of a high-throughput inspection tool. This benchtop product will not only improve current semiconductor technologies but will also be useful for scientists to characterize the next generation of semiconductors._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the advancement of manufacturing technologies for industries such as telecommunications, data communications, sensors. and defense. Most of the internet relies on data centers to process data, and this processing is accomplished via a device called an optical transceiver. These transceivers house an optical fiber, which is as thin as a single strand of human hair, attached to a chip device to transfer information to\/from the data centers. The optical fiber is so small that it is very difficult to precisely connect the fiber to the chip, often resulting in performance losses. With greater than100,000 transceivers per data center and greater than2,700 data centers in the United States, it is important to have good fiber connection for reduced power consumption and increased performance. Technology companies are also looking for chips with multiple fibers, making the need for better fiber placement even greater. In this project, the company focuses a new technology that makes fiber placement on a chip faster, more accurate, and cheaper. This new technology uses a special component that enables fiber placement with precision while improving the device performance 4 times. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses major pain points for optical transceiver companies: cost and time to package an optical fiber to a silicon photonic chip. The proposed product consists of a fusion splicing machine and a novel silicon dioxide mode converter. The mode converter localizes heat from the laser, enabling fusion while simultaneously decreasing the loss level. This technology packages silicon photonic devices without compromising performance. It significantly improves packaging speed from 10 minutes to 2 minutes, increases power efficiency by 4X, and provides a 50% savings. The company has demonstrated coupling losses lower than the industry standard of 3 dB on specialty chips. The research objectives involve improving coupling losses to around 1 dB, demonstrating splicing with foundry chips, and improving the strength of the fusion splice for improved reliability. The completion of these objectives will result in extremely low loss photonic packaging applicable for use with foundry chips, increasing the commercialization potential of the technology. This technology will enable customers to package single or multi-fiber devices with high efficiency, low cost, and at high volumes, ultimately increasing production capacity across many industries._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The Problem Being Addressed The laser-based electron accelerator is an innovative tool to obtain GeV to TeV electron energies for high-energy particle physics experiments. The development of high-power laser systems for these accelerators, however, puts stringent challenges on the very limits of the laser materials themselves. The enormous heat generated by the high power creates great thermal stress that leads to effects such as birefringence, thermal lensing, or even physical fracture damage to the host. The issue can be mitigated by using fiber or thin-disk lasers with effective cooling. The next generation of accelerators, however, will require higher powers than can be produced by the current state-of-the-art. To address this challenge, RMD and our STTR partner, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory will investigate the design and fabrication of thin-disk ceramic composite laser gain media with a 3-D doping profile. Ceramics offer other advantages over single crystals in providing the flexibility to tailor the doping concentration and profile with lower inherent cost, higher yield, relaxed constraints on size and shape, and control of composition. In addition, ceramics are generally more robust than single crystals toward thermal or mechanical shock and resistant to mechanical and thermal damage. Yb-doped sesquioxide possesses a cubic structure and high thermal conductivity and is a well-known candidate for the short pulse, high-power laser gain media application. During the Phase II study, we will design and fabricate Yb-doped sesquioxide thin disk gain media suitable for high-power, short pulse lasers with a built-in 3D doping profile to improve the gain distribution, fine-tune the process to produce transparent ceramic disks with the appropriate doping gradient structure, , characterize the physical, and optical properties of the thin gain media discs., fabricate and test a high quality 25-40mm ceramic disks suitable for constructing a 3kW laser. Finally, we will demonstrate a diode-pumped thin disk laser with a tailored doping profile. There are two target markets for our technology. The first segment consists of national labs and universities both in the U.S. and globally that will want to use our technology for scientific research and in current and future high-power laser accelerators. This market is typically categorized as part of the scientific research and military market. Global revenue for laser systems used in the scientific research and military markets grew from $922 million in 2017 to $2.248 billion in 2020 The second market segment is the materials processing and lithography market. This market includes lasers used for all types of metal processing (welding, cutting, annealing, drilling); semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing (lithography, scribing, defect repair, via drilling); The lithography equipment segment is used to print complex circuit patterns on silicon wafers that are mainly raw materials for integrated circuits. This process is considered to be one of the most expensive and critical steps in wafer fabrication."

        "Abstract": "The use of coal waste and biomass has significant environmental benefits, and it can contribute to promoting a low-carbon economy via hydrogen production. These feedstocks can be cost effective, are readily available, and in the case of biomass are renewable with the near elimination of greenhouse gases. But there are issues with gasifying waste coal and biomass. The first one is the widely varying organic makeup and moisture content of the feedstock which makes optimization and proper control of the gasifier challenging. The second is the impact on the slag properties of the inert part of the fuel, affecting reactor operation and reliability. To solve these issues the project team developed machine learning (ML) enhanced diagnostics to enable gasifiers to process coal waste and biomass optimally and economically; thus, avoiding them from being landfilled and taking advantage of their value and favorable environmental properties. Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) along with the use of advanced ML signal processing can accurately measure important properties of the feedstock such as proximate and ultimate analyses, and ash content, elemental concentrations, heating value, and ash slagging temperatures. This is done in-situ and in real time allowing the operators to accurately control their gasification process to tight tolerances never before possible. Phase I the project team successfully completed the feasibility testing of the ML-Enhanced LIBS instrument. We conducted extensive laboratory testing on several biofuels and waste coals and mixtures. We collected 64,000 spectral shots and converted them into to 12 parameters including heating value, fusion temperature, ash content and nine elements&apos; concentration. We achieved outstanding accuracies and repeatability thus clearly demonstrating the instruments promise. In Phase II we will acquire a commercial-ready instrument (TRL of 7) and test it on a large number of coal waste and biomass while they are being moved on a conveyor belt. We will use the resulting ML algorithms and program them into the instrument. Data will be taken in realtime while the feedstocks are moving on the belt. Finally, we will use well-developed gasifier simulators and apply our instrument&apos;s data to determine the performance gains to be made. The instrument will be used on gasifiers which will provide real time data on their feedstock and allow them to better control their operation and optimize their performance. Other markets include the coal-fired power plant, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) plant, and biofuel processing facilities."

        "Abstract": "XUV Lasers, in collaboration with Colorado State University, proposes to develop and commercialize key components for the implementation of ultra-intense laser systems operating at greatly increased repetition rates. Ultra-high power, ultrashort pulse lasers systems are the central tool driving many of the recent advances in high energy density plasma science. They enable the generation of high energy density relativistic plasmas, bright X-ray and gamma\u2013ray burst, energetics particle beams and neutrons, and drive applications such as backlighting of inertial confinement fusion pellets, and to explore non-conventional fusion energy schemes. However, all ultrahigh power lasers are presently limited to low repetition rates (&lt; 10Hz). During Phase II we extended the operation of Yb:YAG cryocooled amplifiers to the highest energy achieved at high repetition rates to date: 2 J at 200 Hz. We also demonstrated the generation of ?=515 nm nanosecond laser pulses of ~ 1 J energy at 1 kHz repetition rate. Finally, we also used a fraction of this green output to pump a Ti:Sa amplifier that produced 110 mJ pulses at 330 Hz repetition rate, a record pulse energy for Ti:Sa amplifiers operating at this high repetition rate. In Phase IIA we propose to further scale these diode-pumped efficiently frequency doubled amplifiers to multi-Joule, and to employ them to pump a Joule-level Ti:Sa amplifier. The modular aspect of the pump laser will allow for. The commercialization of high repetition rate ultra-intense laser amplifiers will have transformative potential in both fundamental science and technology. The ability to gather data at high repetition rates can transform the fields of high energy density science and ultra-high filed physics in which experiments are typically limited to a relatively low number of events and poor statistics. High repetition rate lasers will open the possibility of exploring broad parameter spaces and reducing measurement uncertainties, resulting in high quality data that can serve to benchmark and improve simulations. The commercial availability of high repetition rate lasers can also help to greatly extend the capability of mid-scale high intensity laser facilities, such as those that are part the LaserNetUS, a users\u2019 network of high-power lasers created by DOE to serve the broad scientific community."

        "Abstract": "Studies of laser-driven high energy density plasma physics require large, complex laser systems providing well-controlled pulses at extreme intensities reaching petawatt levels. New facilities, several of which exist within the LaserNetUS consortium, have increased the operation rate such laser sources to the 10 Hz regime, allowing thousands of high energy experiments to be performed within minutes. The ability to collect large data sets will enable more thorough and robust data analysis, particularly by leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. However, high fidelity plasma diagnostics are required at commensurate repetition rates, fully capturing the laser-plasma dynamics of each individual shot, to realize the full research potential of these facilities. While several plasma diagnostic techniques with high temporal resolution exist at 10 Hz, these methods are unable to temporally characterize a single high energy laser plasma event. Since these dynamics take place on timescales ranging from pico- to nanoseconds, imaging techniques with GHz frame rates are required to properly track their evolution; frame gating on the single picosecond level is also necessary to freeze plasma movement withing a single frame. The proposed imaging technique maintains picosecondlevel temporal resolution while simultaneously capturing 2D plasma dynamics at up to 10 GHz. Furthermore, while the current proposal supports 10 Hz delivery of GHz imaging bursts, this delivery rate is only limited by the operation of the petawatt lasers within the LaserNetUS network. Scaling delivery to much higher repetition rates is possible through straightforward modifications of the laser probe source. A system delivering ultrafast pulse bursts at GHz repetition rates was developed and implemented to image laser plasma formation, plasma expansion, and shockwave generation with picosecond resolution. The GHz bursts generated by the laser probe were conditioned such that each pulse within the probe had a distinct temporal delay and spectral content. This allowed a single camera detector image each pulse independently using a spectrally selective imaging system. Achieving single shot GHz imaging with a single camera, while using affordable components and maintaining a compact footprint, is a significant achievement that will provide LaserNetUS research facilities with advanced measurement capabilities that do not currently exist. The GHz laser probe and imaging system will be consolidated into a compact, turn-key commercial system that is readily transportable and provides simple operation by user facilities. This system will be validated at a high energy research lab before being deployed at LaserNetUS facilities. Successful demonstration at LaserNetUS facilities will greatly benefit the Department of Energy and lead to strong commercialization potential. Aside from the direct benefit to the Department of Energy related to GHz rate imaging of high energy density laser plasmas, this technology offers several robust commercialization pathways. There is significant potential for market adoption within the cold ablation and precision laser processing industry, particularly the multi-billion-dollar optical display market that calls for low-heat laser cutting, etching, and marking. Precision laser machining is enabled by products identical to the laser proposed here: ultrafast pulse durations (precision, athermal material modification) at high-repetition rates (GHz) with tunable burst formats (advanced thermal mitigation). The technology used to develop the single camera detection portion of this diagnostic will also be marketed within the compressive imaging sector. This includes applications defense, astronomy, agriculture, molecular biology, biomedical imaging, geosciences, chemical analysis, and food inspection that constitute multibillion-dollar industries. In addition to the commercial potential within the industrial sector, the source developed here will likely receive research funding and commercial sales from academic and government laboratories as a diagnostic research tool, particularly relative to hypersonic imaging and measurements of rotating detonation engines."

        "Abstract": "Problem: The program addresses a critical need for a kilowatt optical power isolator that is not commercially available. This ultra-high optical power isolator is a key component that enables the next generation of kilowatt-class ultrafast laser systems to use in many areas of accelerator applications. This program provides this important laser component to realize novel accelerator concepts for future colliders; in the generation, manipulation, and x-ray seeding of electron beams; in the generation of electromagnetic radiation ranging from THz to gamma rays; and in the generation of the neutron, proton, and light ion beams. With applications demanding ever higher fluxes of particles and radiation, the driving laser technology must also increase in repetition rate\u2014and hence average power\u2014to meet the demand. Presently, no vendor can provide a large aperture isolator with power handling exceeding kW. Objective: The program aims to develop a new generation of free-space optical isolators with significantly higher optical power handling to reach beyond kW pulse and CW operations that have not been attainable. Phase II work: Phase II will result in the fabrication of a fully functional free space isolator capable of 1 kW with transmission exceeding 95% and isolation exceeding 30 dB across the entire 5% bandwidth with an aperture size of 30mm in diameter. The isolators will be extensively tested at our in-house facility to demonstrate their optical performance and thermomechanical stability. The development will validate the advantages of the proposed novel approach and open the avenue for all wavelength high-power isolators to broaden the applications. Analysis and plan will be completed that provides a path to extend the design to 100 kW average power operation. Commercial Application: In addition to the scientific community, The proposed next-generation highpower optical isolators have direct Applications in the high-power laser commercial market. The global industrial laser market was over $3 billion last year."

        "Abstract": "Problem Statement and Approach: Sensitive detection of electromagnetic (EM) fields at microwave frequencies underlies crucially many high-energy physics (HEP) experiments that rely on the measurement of weak couplings between ultralight dark matter and electromagnetism. These HEP experiments require the sensing of EM fields down to single photon level, which, unfortunately, remains a significant challenge. Moreover, highly efficient transduction between microwave photons and optical photons is crucial for a distributed quantum network that is built upon a combination of vastly different quantum systems that operate based upon the quantum states of microwave and optical photons. One elegant approach to resolve this challenge is to convert microwave photons into the optical domain with high efficiency. We proposed to design and fabricate ultrahigh-Q optical microresonators on chipscale thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platform that exhibit optimal electro-optic coupling for applications in ultra-sensitive transduction between microwave and optical photons. The proposed device is expected to offer optical Q &gt; 107 in the telecom band. It enables compact optoelectronic integration that will offer strong transduction between the two spectral regimes. In compared with conventional approaches, the proposed device is expected to offer unprecedented performance with more than 100? reduction of the device footprint and 100? increase of microwave-optical conversion efficiency. In particular, the chipscale fully integrated approach enables wafer-scale mass production that will dramatically reduce the cost. Phase I Accomplishments: Phase I project focused on developing and prototyping high-Q LN microresonators that not only exhibited high optical Q but were also well suited for efficient microwaveto- optic transduction. We have accomplished all our Phase I goals: 1) identify the device geometry that not only supports high optical Q &gt;107, but also produces optimal electro-optic coupling; 2) optimize the fabrication process to improve the optical Q. We have achieved all key objectives of Phase I: 1) Design of device structure for ultrahigh optical Q and small mode volume; 2) Design of device structure for best electro-optic coupling; 3) Fabrication of resonator device and optimization for high optical Q. Phase II Efforts: In Phase II, we will perform in-depth investigation to further improve the device optical quality by further optimization of the fabrication process, particularly on the wafer scale. We will also develop appropriate packaging processes for low-loss chip-fiber coupling and for laser-chip integration. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed project, if successful, will offer to the market the first commercially available cost-effective ultrahigh-Q LN microresonator devices that can be produced massively on the whole wafer scale. These devices will offer an immediate solution to the HEP experiments for ultrasensitive detection of microwave photons. Moreover, the commercial availability of the proposed device with high performance is of immense importance for the development and implementation of distributed quantum network that builds upon disparate quantum systems operating in vastly different spectral regimes from microwave to visible. This SBIR effort aims to directly fulfill this emerging market demand. On the other hand, the proposed devices are of great potential for broad classical applications in radar, biomedicine, infrared\/THz imaging, etc., where sensitive detection of microwaves (and electric field in general) is extremely critical. The resonator devices developed in this SBIR program are expected to have a profound commercial impact on a broad market."

        "Abstract": "To maintain safe operation, aircraft are carefully inspected at regular intervals, or as needed. These inspections are time-consuming and pose risks to both people and aircraft as heavy machinery at considerable heights are involved. Aircraft operators, both military and commercial, are increasingly considering using small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS or \u201cdrones\u201d) to fly around the aircraft and collect imagery to facilitate inspection of aircraft skin damage. Near Earth Autonomy has developed a commercial sUAS prototype and autonomously navigated it around a C-17 aircraft to exhaustively image its upper-facing fuselage and wing surfaces in less than 15 minutes of flying. The sUAS uses our\u00a0real-time, high-precision laser-visual odometry and mapping technology for navigation. Therefore, the sUAS navigates in unstructured environment with no need for any external infrastructure for positioning and navigation. The operation is fully autonomous: the drone takes off, locates the airplane to be inspected, navigates around it to collect images, and lands at the take-off location. The autonomy provides for two critical aspects: (1) safety \u2013 an autonomous UAS is guided much more precisely than with manual flight, and (2) ability to tag images with positional information \u2013 the UAS knows exactly where each picture is taken from and what areas on the aircraft the images are looking at. In addition, the autonomous flight can be relatively fast, thus extending the aircraft coverage for a given sUAS endurance. An operator monitors the performance of the drone through a live graphical user interface on the ground station (a laptop or a tablet). The collected images are analyzed by human inspectors or automated defect detection algorithms. The images and\/or semantically-labeled defects are stored for later reference or future comparison. With the stringent pace of flight schedules in both commercial and defense sector, aircraft down-time costs accumulate significantly. This proposal requests funding to develop a system and the business case of sUAS-based military aircraft inspection through engagement with and flight demonstration to\u00a0Air Force units. It is expected that both the Air Force and Near Earth Autonomy will learn and benefit from this direct exchange leading to product requirements tuned to specific Air Force concepts of operations, increased safety, greater \u201cup-time,\u201d and reduced costs. Applications to civilian aircraft inspection are straightforward as they follow similar inspection patterns."

        "Abstract": "The photoinjector is the key component of electron accelerators such as Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The driving laser system that emits laser pulses on the photocathode inside the photoinjector determines the basic properties of the electron beam like sequence in time, their duration, and the amount of bunch charge. Traditional driving laser system consists of femtosecond ultrafast laser amplifier at 1064nm that is quadrupled to 258nm. The laser pulses also need to stretch to picosecond before delivering to photocathode. The whole laser system is complicated, expensive, and not easy for the maintenance. The pulse energy suffers substantial loss to be less than 1 micro-joule after frequency quadrupling and pulse stretching. Next generation photoinjectors for high brightness light sources demands a pulsed laser system that is tunable in visible range and have MHz repetition rate as well as 10s of micro-joule pulse energy. Raytum Photonics proposes to develop a state-of-art fiber laser system that is tunable in visible range with high pulse energy. The laser system consists of a tunable seed module that can tune the wavelength from 1250nm to 1390 nm, a 40 GHz intensity modulator that can generate a 25-30ps pulse, a Pr doped or Pr-Yb co-doped fluoride fiber amplifier to boost the average power to more than 20W and a second- harmonic generation module to covert the final output to visible range and tunable from 625 nm to 695 nm. Our laser system will generate the pulse train with pulse energy of more than 10 micro-joules and repetition rate in MHz. The advantages of fiber laser system is featured in the several aspects: 1) unlike traditional OPA or OPO laser system, the direct wavelength tuning of semiconductor laser is more reliable and easier to operate; 2) the direct intensity modulation to generate pulse provides flexibility of timing properties like pulse width, pulse shape and repetition rate. The direct ps pulse generation does not require the pulse stretcher used in fs lase system. 3) The fiber amplifier is well-known for its ability of power scaling. 100 W or even kW fiber laser amplifier with fs pulse width has been demonstrated in 1um wavelength domain. During Phase I, Raytum Photonics will concept design and breadboard demonstrate the fiber laser system with the following features: 1) tunable diode laser working around 1300nm and shows the pulse generation using high speed intensity modulator; 2) Pr doped or Pr-Yb doped fiber amplifier with average output power at W level and shows the power scalability; 3) demonstration of second harmonicgeneration with tuning fundamental laser wavelength using either traditional BBO crystal or PPLN crystal. The temperature of crystal needs to adjust for the requirement of phase matching when the fundamental wavelength is tuned. All development work will conduct in Raytum Photonics facility. We are also going to collaborate with SLAC to have a preliminary test with the laser system we develop."

        "Abstract": "As Free-Electron Laser and diffraction-limited storage ring X-ray light sources have come into their own in the past few years, the need for highly precise X-ray mirrors is becoming more and more apparent. These brighter X-ray light sources are being held back by the mirrors that are used, both in the availability of these optics, as well as their manufacturability. There are very few methods that are capable of polishing mirrors to the levels needed as atomic accuracy is something that is both difficult and unreliable to manufacture. To address the shortcomings in reliability in manufacturing, OptiPro proposes to adapt current machinery built at OptiPro into Elastic Emission Machining equipment. Elastic Emission Machining (EEM) has been used for decades in Japan for the precise manufacturing of mirrors for X-ray sources. This process submerges the mirror and tooling in a slurry solution made up of ultra-fine particles. These particles are then accelerated to the surface of the substrate, causing a strong bond to take place. This bond, specifically, is stronger than the covalent bonds of the substrate atoms. The fluid flow then creates a sheer force, causing the particle, and its attached substrate atom, to be removed from the surface. This atomic level of material removal is ideal for the final figuring of X-ray mirrors and can create both geometrically and crystallographically perfect surfaces. In Phase I, we propose to construct a testbed based around our Ultra Form Finisher 300 (UFF 300) which will serve as the motion control system for the EEM process. Novel tooling, a new spindle design, and a slurry containment tank will all be designed and implemented into the UFF 300 to complete its conversion from a standard polishing machine into one capable of EEM. This testbed is capable of polishing optics up to 300 mm in diameter, and we mean to leverage that working envelope to polishing planar optics 200mm in length. X-ray mirrors can range from 100mm to over 1 meter in length, and the upscaling of the machine is deferred to Phase II. The proposed manufacturing system, when successful, will significantly advance the state of the art in polishing techniques, and is a crucial piece when considering the future of X-ray light sources and beam- line optics. While the X-ray mirror industry will benefit from EEM technology, they are not alone. Many industries are now requiring as close to geometrically and crystallographically perfect surfaces to include the semiconductor industry, astronomical telescope elements, defense equipment, and high-power laser systems. The proposed manufacturing testbed will be designed, constructed, and tested at OptiPro facilities in Ontario, NY, just outside of Rochester. The project is expected to last 9.5 months."

        "Abstract": "Free-space transport lines are currently used by DOE to deliver high-power ultrashort pulse laser (USPL) beams from the laser source to the destination of applications. However, free-space transport lines always suffer from laser pointing instability control, optical damages, low transport efficiency, and maintenance difficulty. Most recently, hollow-core fibers filled with dry air, noble gas, or even vacuum have been demonstrated as outstanding transport lines for high-power USPL beam delivery. Leveraging our recent successful fabrication of anti- resonant hollow-core fibers (AR-HCF) and substantial experience in USPLs, NP Photonics proposes to design and develop a polarization-maintaining (PM) AR-HCF-based high-power USPL beam delivery system with high stability, high reliability, high transport efficiency, and automatic coupling capability. In this Phase I program, PM-AR-HCFs at 1-?m will be designed and fabricated, and a high-efficiency and high-reliability beam launching unit with automatic coupling capability will be designed and demonstrated. In Phase II, PM-AR-HCF-based high- power USPL beam delivery systems at 1 ?m and 0.5 ?m, meeting or exceeding the requirements of DOE applications, will be developed and delivered. Dual use applications for the proposed high energy ultrafast lasers include directed energy weapons, material processing, medical applications, and scientific research."

        "Abstract": "Water vapor density is an essential climate parameter that influences atmosphere conditions and contributes to atmospheric dynamics. Existing sensing instrumentation for continuous monitoring of water vapor profiles in the atmosphere are limited by excessive size and weight, spatial resolution limitations, cost, eye-safety, and ability to simultaneously measure near and far-ranges. Aret\u00e9 proposes to adapt a newly developed continuous wave (CW) scanning lidar technology for Differential Absorption Lidar (DiAL) water vapor profiling that will address these challenges. Aret\u00e9\u2019s patented CW scanning lidar technology operates by rapidly scanning a CW laser in a circular or conical scan pattern and imaging the returned light that is also received through the scanning system. The path of scattered light that returns to the scanner lags the scanner direction by an angle that is proportional to the distance to a scattering volume as well as the scanner rotation rate. Pixel coordinates of the imaged light determine the range and direction to the scattering volume. Aret\u00e9 is proposing to adapt an existing lidar system to make differential absorption lidar measurements possible by developing and integrating critical subcomponents. When signals are accumulated around a conical scan, vertical water vapor profiles will be determined with a laser that have 25 times greater average power than can be achieved with 0.5% duty cycle pulsed lasers used in state-of- the-art DiAL lasers. This increased optical power permits a much smaller receiver aperture which will scale the overall sensor volume to be less than a 10th the size of currently available sensors having comparable performance. The Phase-I effort will suppress solar background and improve sensitivity by integrating a new quantum imaging system (QIS) camera that has recently come to market, developing a novel spectral filtering device, and implementing an imaging enhancement component. In Phase-I, we will develop an 828nm laser source for testing purposes and will measure Rayleigh backscattering. The full demonstration of water vapor sensing will be achieved during Phase-II after upgrading the laser system to provide the two stabilized laser wavelengths and maturing the overall sensor controls. Water vapor profiling is sought for both operational forecasting measurements and for climate and environmental sciences. Radiosonde sensing is currently used to provide meteorological data for weather forecasting, but at great expense for relatively sparse data sets. Remote sensing measurements could dramatically reduce the requirement for radiosonde deployment and the related operational expenses while improving the quality of the data available and the accuracy of forecasts. High resolution water vapor data at specific cloud and weather features would improve our ability to refine climate modeling accuracy. Our technology is expected to make measurement campaigns for scientific studies more affordable. Water vapor sensing has additional applications for computing distortions to Radar systems that result from water-vapor dependent refractive variations and potentially for agricultural applications. Aside from the specific application of water vapor profiling, there is an objective to mature the CW scanning lidar technology which has broad ranging applications for sensing distributed media and hard targets. There is a need for detecting low-elevation drones and aerosol plumes where radar systems have degraded signals from ground clutter. Component development and commercialization of the technology for any one application will lower the barriers for transition for any of the other applications. Commercial viability of any of the applications will be increased if applications in multiple areas can be developed."

Founding members of AlchLight invented a scalable laser-chemical hybrid technology that turns regular titanium (Ti) surfaces to hierarchical micro-\/nanostructured TiO2 with an exceedingly increased surface area and an unparallel strong photocatalytic effect. By adding additional Ag nanoparticles, a dramatic local-field enhancement can be achieved through plasmonic effects. This multipronged approach will allow AlchLight to produce a SERS substrate that will yield a highly uniform and reproducible SERS enhancement (&gt;109) and more importantly, the photocatalytic TiO2\/Ag system can degrade the traced molecules adsorbed on surface under light irradiation and recycle the SERS substrate and guarantee the inherent low background signature. The successful completion of this project will lead to a robust and advanced SERS technique for real-world applications. Furthermore, rapid fabrication of the developed SERS substrate is enabled by the world-first femtosecond laser Nano-to-Meter surface functionalization workstation developed by AlchLight."

        "Abstract": "High-density cryogenic wiring is a critical component for gate-based quantum computers, quantum annealing devices, superconducting supercomputers, transition edge sensors, Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors, nanowire single photon detectors, and a wide range of other applications. Quantum computers will be as important to the next hundred years of technology as the internet, integrated circuit, or radio receiver have been to the last 100 years; by relying on properties of quantum mechanics, they will solve problems in seconds that the most powerful classical supercomputers in the world could work on for generations and never scratch their surface.\u00a0This reinvention of computing will lead to a new era of personalized medicine, clean and effectively unlimited power, a deeper understanding of our universe, and a transformed civilization. Quantum will also require the development of a new supply chain that moves technologies out of laboratories and into scaled commercial use. While some of these technologies are obviously complex, such as sub-kelvin cryogenics, single-photon emitters, lasers, and low-temperature electronics, even seemingly straightforward elements of a quantum system, such as wiring, are subject to a global supply pinch and in need of significant innovation to meet the world\u2019s growing demand. The wires used in superconducting systems are typically a major factor in total system cost and an obstacle to scaling up system performance. Moreover, today they can only be commercially sourced from international suppliers such as CoaxCo (Japan), Delft Circuits (Netherlands), or any of a number of Chinese suppliers. Existing solutions are lower density than optimal, leading to practical limits on the number of qubits that can be installed in commercially available cryogenic systems, and exorbitantly expensive -- an individual wire for a quantum system can easily cost upwards of $1,200, meaning that wiring a powerful gate-based quantum computer using existing wiring solutions costs over $250k. Moreover, lead times on delivery of these wires are typically at least several months as these low-scale products are painstakingly manufactured overseas. The novel FLexible coAXial (FLAX) cables to be produced as a result of this proposal create a new type of high-density data cable for superconducting electronics applications which have high density, low attenuation, low crosstalk, and low heat load. It builds on the outstanding performance achieved by UCSB in small-scale production and leverages established manufacturing technologies to scale and economize production."

        "Abstract": "When engaging targets at long distance, time matters: enemies may only be visible for a few seconds at a time and snipers need the ability to deliver accurate, lethal fire in those fleeting seconds. The LA-24\/PEQ Precision Aiming Laser (PAL) system is a game changing piece of technology that runs the industry-leading Applied Ballistics (AB) solver directly onboard, providing a sniper with a firing solution onscreen instantly after ranging a target. The challenge lies in that the PAL has a small OLED display and is usually mounted above the rifle scope, which means that the display is obscured by the elevation turret of the rifle scope. This means that to read and use the firing solution, the sniper must break from his firing position to look at the display before engaging the target, costing him valuable time to get rounds on target. nVision Technology, the engineering team responsible for embedding the AB solver in PAL and many other products, has teamed with Neilsen-Kellerman (NK), creator of the Kestrel line of weathermeters, to propose two Remote Sniper Heads Up Display (RSHUD) approaches to the challenge. The first leverages NK\u2019s existing commercial LCD HUD product, which is a weapon mounted IP67 waterproof display that wirelessly connects to the Kestrel 5700 series of weathermeters. With its backlight on, the current HUD is capable of running for more than 24 hours. nVision will work with NK to upgrade the electronics and shrink the packaging to provide SOCOM with a more capable HUD that communicates to the PAL system through either wired or secure Bluetooth means. These upgrades will add sensor capabilities and the AB solver to allow the LCD HUD to operate independently from the PAL, as well as connect into the entire AB ecosystem of products so that operators can use the LCD HUD with any LRF that includes the AB communications protocol. Additionally, this upgrade will allow the LCD HUD to communicate with nVision\u2019s AB ATAK plugin, which integrates the AB solver into ATAK to seamlessly provide firing solutions for markers on the TAK map; the ATAK plugin will be able to push this targeting info directly to the LCD HUD so the user does not need to have his ATAK EUD in hand to see the solutions. The second RSHUD approach will utilize the same core electronics coupled to a microOLED display and clear optics that will allow nVision to present the same information to the user in a see-through display alongside the rifle scope eyepiece. This approach will enable the operator to maintain situational awareness while still having access to the information that he needs to put rounds on target rapidly and effectively. nVision\u2019s proposed microOLED display is utilized in commercial products like the SIG SAUER 10K binoculars and boasts a 304x256 sunlight-readable display while typically drawing"

The system will include operator controls that serve to both deliver appropriate irradiance to the target area at ranges greater than 900 meters, and to also decrease response times to increase lethality in near and mid-range engagements. The system will survive all applicable warfare environments, such as immersion, recoil, and thermal shock, while maintaining zero position stability and system functionality.

        "Abstract": "The Department of Energy requires research to advance fundamental accelerator technology and its applications to nuclear-physics scientific research. Innovations are sought that will improve Nuclear-Physics Scientific User Facilities and the wider community\u2019s experimental programs. Passivation techniques or other surface treatments to Electron-Cyclotron-Resonance components are of interest to reduce contamination from heavy-ion-induced erosion of alloys used in the Electron-Cyclotron Resonance source.Key properties for the surface passivation layer include:\n1) high secondary electron emission, 2) low heavy-ion erosion rate, 3) excellent adhesion to the metal substrate, 4) smooth surface finish, 5) chemical, thermal, and vacuum stability, 6) thermally conductive surface, and 7) ability to coat inside-diameter surfaces. Our research objective is to demonstrate a novel conversion-coating technology, Plasma Electrolyte Oxidation, to convert value-alloy (e.g., 6061 Aluminum) surfaces to crystalline aluminum-oxide (alumina) and mullite that will exhibit lower sputter yield than either pure Aluminum or bare 6061 Aluminum. This unique high-voltage anodizing method produces adherent, hard crystalline-oxides on value metals\n\/ alloys (e.g., Al, Mg, Ti, Zr, Ta). The method is an immersion non-line-of-sight method enabling it to treat complex shapes, consumes part of the underlying substrate resulting in excellent oxide adhesion, produces a harder surface than conventional \u201chard\u201d anodize, uses environmentally- friendly electrolyte solutions, and can be doped with nanoparticles to improve oxide toughness \/ durability and reduce surface roughness. Our team has already converted several Al alloys (e.g., 3003, 2024, 6061, 7075 Aluminum), Titanium alloys (e.g., pure Titanium and Ti6Al4V), and Zirconium-alloys. We have also added oxide (e.g., alumina, zirconia) and conductive carbide (e.g., silicon carbide, boron carbide) nanoparticles to the electrolyte solution to reduce surface finish and increase toughness of the growing crystalline oxide. From the literature, alumina and magnesium- oxide exhibit a 76.5% and 90% reduction, respectively, in erosion rate when exposed to a 600eV Argon-ion plasma compared to bare Aluminum and Magnesium. Therefore, it appears these oxides will offer a longer-lifetime surface for Electron-Cyclotron-Resonance components. In Phase I, we will coordinate with candidate Department of Energy and University end-users to define components, alloys of construction, and desired oxide thickness. Converted Aluminum- alloy coupons will be prepared with selected electrolytes along with specific nanoparticles for oxide toughening for subsequent characterization and testing. Surface characterizations will include: 1) tape-peel and tensile plug bond-adhesion measurements, 2) surface finish measurements using Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy, 3) vacuum compatibility and Argon- ion erosion in a vacuum chamber (using weight change as the metric), 4) X-ray diffraction to determine the alumina, mullite phases formed, and 5) conversion-coating thickness, morphology, and composition using Scanning Electron Microscopy\/Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy. Down- selection of the best Plasma Electrolyte Oxidation parameters will be made in Phase I for recommendations for additional characterization in Phase II. This will include shipment of Plasma Electrolyte Oxidation processed coupons (e.g., extraction electrode) to Department of Energy or University Laboratories for screening in actual plasma \/ ion environments to provide a more realistic assessment of erosion-rate, adhesion, and lifetime. After these more realistic exposures, subscale or actual components will be processed by Plasma Electrolyte Oxidation to demonstrate application to Electron-Cyclotron-Resonance components. We will also survey the Nuclear- Physics community to learn about additional application areas, such as electron-ion collider and superconducting radio-frequency cavities, among other suitable components. Other application areas include wear and corrosion-resistant surfaces for components used in recreational and transportation vehicles, agriculture equipment, and components for military vehicles.Keywords: plasma-electrolytic-oxidation, crystalline aluminum-oxide, conversion-immersion, non-line-of-sight, ion-erosion, surface-finish, adhesion, toughness, complex-shapesSummary of Members of Congress: Demonstration of erosion-resistant oxide coatings on the internal surface of Electron-Cyclotron-Resonance source chambers will reduce contamination of sources thereby increasing the performance, reliability, and increase component lifetime.

        "Abstract": "Photocathodes are critical for generation of high-brightness electron beams in accelerators that are used in science, industry, and medical disciplines. A visible wavelength-tunable picoseconds laser is required to support optimization of photocathodes leading to more compact, high-performance, and cost-effective systems. Such lasers are not available commercially. With new sources of high-brightness electron beams affordable for universities, commercial laboratories (e.g., semiconductor material development), and hospitals, the US would be able to maintain its technological leadership. In the proposed Phase I, we will experimentally validate and characterize the performance of Aqwest\u2019s concept, anchor our predictive models, validate future scaling, and use these results to design a Phase II prototype driver. Means for pulse selection and synchronization will be evaluated. We will also generate plans for Phase II and eventual commercialization. In Phase II, we plan to develop and demonstrate a photocathode drive laser meeting the DOE functional requirements. Commercialization plans will be further refined and put into effect. Our innovative architecture enabled by the advent of SC lasers offers a direct path to the development and early deployment of visible wavelength- tunable photocathode drivers. The tunable laser developed by this project will also become an important tool for a broad range of applications. For example, in laser material processing such as cutting, welding, surface treatment, 3D printing, a tunable high-average power laser offers a new capability to precisely tune into specific absorption features of the workpiece. This new capability promises to revolutionize the field and possibly create new industry segments. A tunable blue-to-red laser is also needed for medical imaging and photodynamic therapy for cancer. A tunable laser scanning through the spectrum is desired as an illuminator for active hyper-spectral imaging for long-standoff remote sensing especially for ecological, environmental, agricultural, and industrial purposes."

        "Abstract": "For this Phase II proposal, MZA and Etegent Technologies Inc. have teamed to leverage our complementary skill sets and put together a comprehensive force emulation solution for DE systems. MZA has extensive experience in the quantification and analysis of DE aero-effects data. This includes pressure loading and finite element analysis to predict the jitter performance beam directors. Etegent Technologies compliments these skills by with their expertise in vibration emulation and mechanical response characterization. We will design and fabricate a prototype force emulator for sub-scale DE systems. The system will accept user supplied pressure field data and employ a suite of linear actuators to impart realistic forcing in the system. We will undergo a standard SRR, PDR, CDR cycle to select components and design mounting structure. Additional algorithm development will take Phase I technology and expand its use for a multi degree of freedom system. The prototype will be assembled and tested at MZA Dayton using a surrogate beam director provided by the University of Notre Dame. Finally, system will be delivered and demonstrated at the Environmental Laser Test Facility (ELTF) using the HARDROC sub-scale beam director."

The compact size low weight and low power specificationsmake this instrument highly portable so that it can be used not only for airborne measurements butalso any environmental measurement application where available power may be limited includingland vehicle and stationary ground-based measurements. The use of a drone or small UAV as thetransport vehicle for the instrument will greatly reduce the cost of making frequent measurementsover agricultural sites or other measurement targets.The Phase I project objectives are to:\u00ef\u201a\u00b7 Construct a laboratory prototype instrument to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.\u00ef\u201a\u00b7 Extensively characterize the sensitivity and stability of the system in the laboratory and instationary outdoor measurements.\u00ef\u201a\u00b7 Test the system in flight using a drone owned by Southwest Sciences.The results of the Phase I project will establish the feasibility of drone-based measurementof the three most important greenhouse gases using two diode lasers and will be the foundation foroptimizing the design of the Phase II prototype.Commercial applications exist in agricultural research and agribusiness where monitoringgreenhouse gas emissions is needed. The technology also has a connection to agriculturally-relatedenergy efficiency as the monitoring instrumentation could be useful in development of methanecapture and utilization technologies. It may be useful in optimizing nitrogen fertilization strategiesfor best crop production and minimal greenhouse gas emissions and for monitoring emissions fromanimal production facilities and guiding waste mitigation strategies.In addition to commercialapplications in agriculture this technology can be adapted to other gases and platforms for airquality and pollution monitoring in other industrial enterprises or atmospheric researchapplications."

A scalable hardware &amp; software architecture assures modularity and easy scalability to different form factors (e.g. different shapes like domes or CAOC size facilities). The goal is a flexible and affordable immersive display at a scale compatible with the scope and complexity of any visualization tool or virtual model.\u00a0 P-POD is made possible by STL\u2019s patented commercially-proven software platform, PANDAS, that aggregates automatically a matrix of projectors to create an interactive display on surfaces of any shape and size. Currently PANDAS operates\u00a0 on a single server with up to 8 projectors. In Phase I we explored the feasibility of a scalable multi-server architecture to enable much larger displays where each server runs a set number of projectors and\u00a0 the conglomeration of multiple servers, connected to a master-server, can drive an unlimited number of\u00a0 projectors.\u00a0 In this Phase II we will develop\u00a0 the key components of a multi-server display (both hardware and software) delivering a prototype P-POD using the proposed scalable multi-server architecture.\u00a0 With the funds available, we have limited the scope of this proposal to a single source, a single user and a single unified interaction modality of a laser pen on a display driven by a multi-server architecture.\u00a0 The full vision of the P-POD entails multiple sources to be presented side by side in their native resolution(s) where multiple users can interact both with the source and the layout of multiple sources (stacked or otherwise) using an unified interaction modality (e.g. laser pens or tablets or hand gestures) simultaneously. The adaptations that would make a full version P-POD possible are an efficient multi-server computing architecture that will drive the P-POD via a virtual desktop; an extension of PANDAS to multi-servers in an efficient manner to provide optimal performance; unification of interaction (via laser pen, tablet, mouse or hand gestures) seamlessly across multiple servers that can be carried out with the virtual desktop in real time by multiple users; an efficient source server that allows flexible layout of the multiple sources that can be changed interactively by the user via the same unified interaction modality; and a source management software that is completely opaque to the users providing the perception that the users are operating one large desktop driven by a single server."

        "Abstract": "Current electron accelerator technologies are fundamentally limited by the photoinjector, where efficient generation of electron bunches with low emittance is required for high performance electron beams. Many facilities currently use photocathode materials with excitation by high power ultraviolet pulses, which places extreme demands on system components. Therefore, photocathode materials with excitation bands in the visible spectrum are being developed. One impediment to a systematic survey and characterization of these materials is the lack of a suitable high power excitation laser that can be tuned across a wide range with high performance. We propose to develop a laser-driven optical parametric amplification system, which will provide tunable picosecond pulses in the visible spectrum at high energy and high repetition rate. Our system emphasizes efficiency in the choice of laser, design of the optical parametric amplifier, and form of the broadband amplified light. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed technique for the generation of tunable visible pulses with tens of picoseconds pulse duration. We will build a prototype of our novel seed source and construct an initial optical parametric amplifier to test performance. We will numerically model scaling the proposed technique to systems with &gt; 100 W average power. Our proposed instrument will provide a valuable tool that can ultimately enable next generation electron accelerator user facilities to operate on a smaller footprint, be built at lower cost, and enhance availability, therefore increasing applications in the medical, research, and security sectors. Our proposed instrument also serves the ultrafast laser market by providing both tunable picosecond pulses, and amplified femtosecond pulses in spectral regions that lack broad gain bandwidths in standard laser materials."

        "Abstract": "Problem: While the photovoltaic manufacturing market is dominated by foreign-produced Si,\nUS manufacturing has an edge in the mature cadmium telluride (CdTe) industry with\nrapidly-growing companies such as Toledo Solar, our development partner, and First Solar\nleading this market. The back contact in a CdTe device has traditionally been made using\ncopper-doped zinc telluride (ZnTe:Cu) or high work function metals such as molybdenum and\ntellurium, both of which rely upon metal sputtering systems that are energy-intensive, expensive\nto purchase and maintain, and also require multiple laser scribing steps for interconnection of\ncells. Crucially, these contacts result in detrimental energetic barriers, known as Schottky\nbarriers, lowering cell efficiency ultimately limiting the maximum efficiency of the solar cells as\nother aspects of CdTe improve.\nSolution: NanoSpray\u2019s innovative contact ink will revolutionize how CdTe back contacts are\nmanufactured. NanoSpray\u2019s inks leverage next-generation nanomaterials that form ideal\nelectrical contact to CdTe and can replace sputter deposition with inexpensive solution\nprocessing. Direct-writing of NanoSpray\u2019s ink will allow for precise control of device contacts\nand interconnects and remove the need for two out of three laser scribes in the manufacturing\nprocess. We anticipate that our technology will lower the production cost and improve the\nefficiency of CdTe PV.\nPhase I Plan: In Phase I, we plan to use inkjet printing to deposit NanoSpray inks as contacts\nand interconnects. Inkjet printing has very precise control of linewidth and location while\nmaintaining high throughput (Aim 1). Direct-writing will also allow us to make semi-transparent\ncontacts to maintain high conductivity and beneficial electronic properties, while simultaneously\nallowing light ingress to the backside of the module, allowing for potential future bifacial and\ntandem configurations (Aim 2). Finally, we will scale up to develop monolithically integrated\nmodules that do not require the P3 scribe (Aim 3).\nPublic Benefit: The success of NanoSpray\u2019s innovation would benefit thin-film PV\nmanufacturers, solar developers, and residential solar consumers. As the solar economy scales to\nmeet growing demand for renewable energy, this will enable US thin-film manufacturers to\ncompete on the global market, and ensure greater market penetration of US-made thin-film solar.\nThere will be an additional indirect benefit to society, as deployment of renewable energy offsets\nthe fossil fuels responsible for localized effects such air pollution, as well as global effects such\nas climate change and ocean acidification."

        "Abstract": "Statement of the problem or situation that is being addressed in your application:\nGreat strides have been made in the development of ultra-fast, high rep-rate lasers and have\nenabled research advancements in everything from extreme ultraviolet photolithography for the\nsemiconductor industry to the study of high energy density plasmas. These advanced light\nsources require similar advances in detectors to help unlock the broad scientific applications\nbeing studied. Ultra-fast lasers and dynamically evolving experiments require imaging systems\nthat can operate on similar timescales and high rep-rate facilities require these imagers to\noperate at a corresponding rep-rate, generating significant data read-off challenges.\nGeneral statement of how this problem is being addressed:\nAdvanced hCMOS Systems will license novel hCMOS imaging detectors developed at Sandia\nNational Laboratories, port the design from the existing Sandia proprietary CMOS7 foundry\nprocess to a commercial foundry and engage in design innovations to increase the rep rate from\n2 Hz to &gt; 100 Hz.\nWhat is to be done in Phase I?\nAdvanced hCMOS Systems will identify a US based, radiation hardened, commercially available\nfoundry process appropriate for unique needs of an hCMOS imager. They will perform full unit\npixel design, layout, and simulations to verify this process port is feasible. Additionally, there will\nbe novel design work to establish a readout architecture suited for high replication rates of &gt; 100\nHz. This will require a full redesign of the readout architecture to accommodate this high pixel\nthroughput.\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits (limited to the space provided):\nPhase II\/III will fund full sensor design and fabrication for a commercially available product.\nThese sensors have broad applications across many realms of high speed research. Ultra-fast\nDual Image Correlation (DIC) experiments for materials science, pulsed laser beam diagnostics,\nultra-fast X-ray imaging, and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) to name a few. The market\nfor high speed imagers is large and the time-scales that hCMOS operates in are not offered\ncommercially with the trade space and total performance specs offered by an hCMOS detector.\nIncreasing the replication rate will only increase the potential market for these devices."

        "Abstract": "Studies of laser-driven high energy density (HED) plasma physics require large, complex laser systems providing well-controlled pulses at extreme intensities reaching TW and PW levels. New facilities, several of which exist within the LaserNetUS consortium, have increased the operation rate of 10-100 TW laser sources to the 10 Hz regime, allowing thousands of HED experiments to be performed within minutes. The ability to collect large data sets will enable more thorough and robust data analysis, particularly by leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. However, high fidelity HED plasma diagnostics are required at commensurate repetition rates to realize the full research potential of these facilities. While several plasma diagnostic techniques with high temporal resolution exist at 10 Hz, these methods are unable to temporally characterize a single HED plasma event. Since HED plasma diagnostics take place on ps \u2013 ns time scales, imaging techniques with GHz frame rates are required to track the evolution of HED plasmas; frame gating on the single ps level is also necessary to freeze plasma movement withing a single frame. The proposed imaging technique maintains ps-level temporal resolution while simultaneously capturing 2D plasma dynamics on 100 ps timescales. Furthermore, while the current proposal supports 10 Hz delivery of GHz imaging bursts, this delivery rate is only limited by the operation of the TW and PW lasers within the LaserNetUS network. Scaling delivery to kHz levels is possible through straightforward modifications of the laser probe source. Spectral Energies will leverage its industry leading laser diagnostics capabilities to develop a compact, turn-key system suitable for deployment at LaserNetUS facilities and future commercialization efforts. Dr. Enam Chowdhury at the Ohio State University will lead the implementation of the GHz frame rate HED plasma imaging source. His ultrafast laser laboratory will initially demonstrate the system\u2019s spatial and temporal resolution using laser generated plasmas with densities sufficient for comparison with those generated at multi-TW HED laboratories. Aside from the direct benefit to the Department of Energy related to GHz rate imaging of HED laser plasmas, this technology offers several robust commercialization pathways. There is significant potential for market adoption within the cold ablation and precision laser processing industry, particularly the multi-billion dollar optical display market that calls for low-heat laser cutting, etching, and marking. Precision laser machining is enabled by products identical to the laser proposed here: ultrafast pulse durations (precision, athermal material modification) at high-repetition rates (GHz) with tunable burst formats (advanced thermal mitigation). In addition to the commercial potential within the industrial sector, the source developed here will likely receive research funding and commercial sales from academic and government laboratories. SE\u2019s well-established partnerships with government laboratories will be strengthened with this new diagnostic research tool, particularly relative to hypersonic imaging and measurements of rotating detonation engines."

        "Abstract": "The detection of optical light has made steady advances over decades to the point where observing sub\nnanosecond events has become routine, but the x-ray regime has not kept pace. As a consequence, radiation\nhard x-ray imaging detectors with frame rates &gt; 10 Hz are lacking. This technology gap is not only\ndetrimental to scientific progress in traditional x-ray science fields like free electron lasers (FELs), but also\nin studying high energy density (HED) events like fusion. As the US moves toward cleaner sources of\nenergy, fusion might hold the key to breaking the hold of fossil fuels in the energy market.\nThe next generation of detector technology will enable practical applications of fusion technology through\nfundamental understanding of the physics behind it. The small business, with consultation from another\nspecialized company, will advance a program to grow ultra-fast imaging detector technology for HED\nphysics and synchrotron markets. The consulting team is composed of experts formerly working in a\nnational laboratory sensor development group. The sensor group developed a ROIC (read out integrated\ncircuit) that can capture 2-D data with a minimum gate time of 1-2 ns and only tens of picoseconds of jitter.\nThese systems have a range of features that are attractive for fast, high energy imaging including up to 1.5\nx 106 electron full well capacity, eight stored frames, 25 \u00b5m pixels, and tiling to produce larger arrays. The\nsmall business will leverage existing prototype sensors and electronics developed at national laboratories\nto define requirements for a robust commercial prototype suitable for a variety of markets and scientific\napplications.\nThe main objectives of the Phase I program will be to study the designs of the national lab developed ROIC\nand generate a product roadmap for a robust commercial camera system. To complete these objectives the\nsmall business will initiate transfer of system knowledge required for camera development with the\nspecialized company as they transfer of the ROIC fabrication process to a commercial producer. Existing\nlaboratory electronics systems will also be evaluated for features to implement in a commercial device, and\npreliminary design documentation will be generated based on these results.\nDesigning a commercial device based on the imaging ROIC above will result in camera configurations that\nserve a broad set of scientists FEL, fusion, and HED physics communities. The potential for immediate\nimpact of a commercial product is at national laboratory facilities currently using proof of concept camera\nsystems. A commercial offering will allow time and resources to better focus on science instead of\ndebugging or repairing less robust systems."

        "Abstract": "Nitrous oxide is the third most important greenhouse trace gas after carbon dioxide and methane and is a dominant ozone depleting substance. Its emissions to the atmosphere are extremely heterogeneous in space and time. Novel approaches to characterize such heterogeneity for incorporation into models and to identify effective mitigation strategies are greatly needed. Commercial instruments for flux measurement of CH4 are available and have been deployed in global measurement campaigns such as FLUXNET. However, similar instruments for nitrous oxide do not exist, as it presents greater measurement challenges. Southwest Sciences, Inc. is addressing this need through an intensive program of further development, field testing, and commercialization of low power laser-based systems that measure nitrous oxide, methane, and carbon dioxide emissions. The instruments developed in this project will allow accurate, simultaneous measurements of greenhouse gas emissions at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales in a robust, low-power field package. The Phase I effort demonstrated that our nitrous oxide gas analyzer technology can be packaged into a compact, low power, light weight system that can run on battery power for extended times for use at remote study sites. Field tests demonstrated that the gas analyzer performance provides the speed and resolution required for eddy covariance flux determinations and, when combined with a sonic anemometer, provides data that can be processed to provide meaningful flux values. In Phase II, modifications that will allow the system to run unattended for longer periods of time while logging data to an onboard data storage device will be made. In addition, a new gas multigas analyzer that will simultaneously measure nitrous oxide, methane and carbon dioxide in a single instrument will be developed and field tested. Commercial instruments for measuring nitrous oxide fluxes and for measuring nitrous oxide, methane and carbon dioxide simultaneously are envisioned. The technology could be widely applied across existing and future FLUXNET, AmeriFlux, ARM and other atmospheric science networks. The instrument will allow researchers, regulators, and environmental consultants to accurately and effectively measure emissions at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales in a quick, efficient, and easy manner."

        "Abstract": "In the Phase 1 program Optical Engines Inc successfully developed the required technologies and components for a monolithic fiber amplifier harness based on 85um 3C Ultra Large Mode Area (ULMA) gain fibers. These types of ULMA fibers are required for achieving multi mj per pulse operation in Chirped Pulse Fiber Amplifiers (CPA) with reduced fiber non linearities needed for low femtosecond (fs) operation and hundreds of Watts of average power. To date these ULMA fibers such as Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) Rod fibers and Chiral Coupled Core (3C) fibers have only been used in architectures where the signal and pump are coupled via free space optical means. For higher average powers, robustness, reliability, and reduced size and cost in large count parallel fiber amplifier systems, a monolithic system is absolutely necessary and OEI has delivered to the University of Michigan a fully monolithic 3C fiber amplifier module. These 3C ULMA type fibers are especially challenging because by their very nature they are weakly guiding and thus very sensitive to any micro bending and other stresses that might come about during the use of these fibers to create monolithic components such as combiners and mode adapters. Optical Engines has the unique capabilities and expertise to create these low stress monolithic devices for fully integrated fiber amplifier harnesses based on ULMA fibers.\nIn the Phase 2 program OEI will develop this harness into a fully integrated fiber amplifier module and deliver 4 development amplifiers and 4 production amplifiers to LBNL for integration into their 40 Channel ultrafast coherently combined fiber laser array. This phase effort will directly lead to commercial sales both into the LBNL fiber array and also into the $7B ultrafast laser market with a fully commercialized product. In addition, OEI will develop a cost reduced amplifier module for use in envisioned multi thousand count laser arrays. This phase 2 product will result in a fully developed commercialized product for immediate availability into the lager ultrafast commercial market."

        "Abstract": "There is a critical need to accurately monitor the buildup of various fluoride and chloride salts as well as critical states of uranium present in molten salt reactors to prevent corrosion that would not only reduce the efficiency of power generation but also endanger operation safety of the facility. Online monitoring is, thus, needed for key salt parameters and the level of dissolved alloy constituents to implement corrosion control technologies to ensure that the reactor is operating within safety limits. To overcome these technical challenges, we propose using a broadband dual frequency comb source to characterize fuel materials. To do this, a small sample of the fuel material will be ionized into a plasma by an intense laser pulse. The plasma is then probed by dual frequency comb (DFC) and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to provide the characteristic spectrum for different fuel materials at high resolution over a broad spectral range. Because this is an optical technique, where no sample handling is required since the plasma can be generated at a safe distance away by the laser, any radiation hazard, specifically from nuclear materials can be minimized. We have assembled a furnace capable of reaching 510 \u00b0C allowing us to perform LIBS experiments on molten salts where trace elements of 150 ppm (part-per-million) could be detected. DFC experiments were performed with cerium, a surrogate for uranium where we demonstrated the high resolving power of the DFC technology. Some molten salts studied in Phase I included sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and LKE (LiCl- KCl eutectic). The proposed technology using a broadband dual frequency comb source for high precision absorption spectroscopy can be used to identify, characterize and analyze various materials for elemental composition and isotopic analysis in real-time. This may an alternative to conventional mass spectrometry where sample handling and analysis can take up to a few weeks long. Our technology will also be much more compact than mass spectrometer, allowing our technology to be more suitable for field applications and in challenging environments."

        "Abstract": "Statement of the Problem: Forensic analysis of particles of special nuclear materials found in the environment is used to gain crucial information about compliance of nations with processing of nuclear materials. Multiple analytical techniques are needed to reach high certainty conclusions in a short timeframe but means of combining these techniques has heretofore been disjointed. This project seeks to develop a unified characterization approach of high sensitivity and rapidity that incorporates multiple analytical modalities for enhanced certitude of the outcome.\nHow this problem is being addressed: A new tool for multi-modal elemental and isotopic microanalysis of solids, Stigmatic Laser Ion Microscope (SLIM), has been proposed. The SLIM combines stigmatically imaging mass spectrometry (MS) with in-situ optical microscopy. It will enable parallel and instantaneous detection of ions laser-ablated from large ~100\u00b5m\u00d7100\u00b5m fields of view with high lateral (~200 nm) and depth (~1 nm) resolutions. This approach will enable rapid (&lt;1 hour) acquisition of high resolution 2-D isotopic maps over 1 cm2 areas with exact registry with a sub-micron-resolving collinear light microscope.\nWhat was done in Phase I: In Phase I, the optical front-end of the SLIM was designed. It combines achromatic light optics with ion extraction and projection optics. Light optics were fabricated, passed extensive testing, demonstrated submicron lateral resolution, and delivered a flat-top laser probe on the sample. This work retired most important engineering risks and successfully demonstrated a proof of concept.\nWhat is planned for the Phase II project: We propose to design, build, and demonstrate an alpha prototype of the SLIM. It will function as a stigmatically imaging linear time-of-flight (TOF) MS with ion source based on a deep-ultraviolet femtosecond laser probe. The probe will feature a square flat-top beam profile for homogeneous irradiation of large spots. Ion optics will be manufactured and integrated with the existing light optics to form the front-end of the laser ionization MS with pulsed ion extraction. The alpha SLIM will be then demonstrated in operation with test samples.\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits: Usually, MS is the technique with the highest analytical sensitivity available. Yet, commercially available imaging MS instruments perform analyses in raster-scanned microprobe mode at low speed and with moderate sensitivity. The SLIM will make major improvements on both fronts. This combination of properties is expected to foster adoption in fields such as nuclear forensics, geological and environmental sciences, materials science, and life sciences."

        "Abstract": "Fusion and high energy density physics facilities perform ultra-fast timing experiments that require good quantum efficiency in deep UV and x-ray regimes. As an example, beam timing measurements at free electron laser facilities monitor timing for electron bunch pulses with 100 kHz repetition rates in laser- driven shock, plasma, and optical\/UV pump-probe experiments. These measurements require detector rise- fall times to be below 50 ps to monitor coarse timing. Device size is another important factor, particularly in the crowded and complex target chambers of fusion facilities. The need for robust, condensed packaging, and picosecond time resolution extends to fields of laser characterization, synchrotrons, and high-speed communication. There is not currently a fast photodiode available in the market with a UV\/x-ray response time &lt; 50 ps. Readout electroncis that can take advantage of the fast time response are nearly as rare.\nA photodiode based off of a metal semiconductor metal technology will be fabricated, tuned and tested to produce &lt; 50 ps response times with high QE for ultra violet and x-ray wavelengths. To complement this technology, integrated readout electronics will be developed to complete the photodiode system.\nDuring Phase I, knowledge transfer for diode photo-lithoraphic fabrication was completed. Two iterations of prototype packaging were produced, EUV response was tested, and prototype diode response time with AlGaN thin film substrate was validated to be &lt; 25 ps. Readout electronics research and customer discus- sions also led to the conclusion that developing low cost, fast electronics would be on the critical path to bringing this product to the market.\nThe main objective of Phase II will be to develop and test integrated readout electroncics with the photodiode prototype developed in Phase I in target applications. This effort will include review of Phase I designs, development of analog front end electronics, and system integration with a high speed software interface. A research vein of the project will continue advancing diode fabrication. It will focus on studying alternative substrates to sapphire with a closer lattice constant to AlGaN and GaN, and study p-i-n diode structure performance instead of metal semiconductor metal which will have long term manufacturing benefits.\nA commercially supported fast photodiode with sub-50 ps resolution will enable scientists to conduct other- wise impossible timing measurements in pulse time monitoring and pump-probe experiments. Free electron laser facilities and pulsed soft x-ray source researchers will be able to measure pulse to pulse variations. Larger facilities observing dozens of ultra-violet and soft x-ray pulses simultaneously can take advantage of the integrated electronics, removing the need to allocate expensive oscilloscopes to a single application."

        "Abstract": "Synchrotron light sources and x-ray free electron lasers are now generating shorter pulses with more intense light than ever before possible, granting unparalleled access to new discoveries. X-ray detectors have not kept pace with these improvements. The field of soft x-ray detection is particularly lagging due to low signal levels resulting from the lower energy x-rays and high vacuum requirements. Existing detectors are often not commercially available, and do not address the need for single photon counting, event counting, and high image resolution simultaneously. This technology gap prevents advancements in fields like time resolved photoemission or x-ray photon-correlation spectroscopy. The proposed program will advance the development of a novel coupled microchannel plate (MCP) - application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) soft x-ray detector for multi-event encoding soft x-ray experiments. Laboratory prototypes of the detector demonstrated single photon sensitivity correlation of 104 simultaneous events with &lt; 2 ns time resolution using a commercial ASIC. The technology exists in a laboratory setting but is not widely available to the soft x-ray community. The proposed program will leverage developments in the literature and begin transitioning the technology to a commercial instrument. During Phase I, a conceptual commercial design and preliminary product roadmap. Steps needed to bring existing laboratory level technology to a commercial level were scoped. The team identified a microchannel plate manufacturing partner and selected a commercially available application specific integrated circuit most suitable for user applications. In addition, a system architecture for the first commercial prototype based on existing detector technology at the small business. The system is composed of a backplane board suitable for connecting multiple ASICs packaged as sensors for the detector. The primary objective of the proposed program is to test a commercial prototype at a beamline or equivalent soft x-ray source. A system will be designed and built to accommodate an in-vacuum sensor assembly consisting of the integrated circuit and microchannel plate, design commercial level electronics, and readout architecture design. Electronics and readout systems include design and layout of front-end detector electronics, frame grabber cards, and a user interface. Input from potential customers and beamline scientists will be integrated into the design and future product roadmap throughout the process. A robust and commercially supported detector with the low signal amplification of a microchannel plate and simultaneous event encoding ability of a commercial integrated circuit will enable discovery in soft x- ray experiments not currently possible. Current commercial offerings often use indirect detection which limits temporal resolution and are only capable of counting &lt; 10 simultaneous events (multi-anode photomultiplier tubes). This proposed detector will provide good time resolution, &lt; 10 \u00b5m spatial resolution with centroiding, and encoding thousands of simultaneous single photon events, drastically improving scientist\u2019s ability to collect data, and allowing greater insight into materials."

        "Abstract": "The soil microbiome is a complex system that plays a central role in biogeochemical processing of nutrients and impacts the exchange of trace species between the atmosphere and subsurface environment. Understanding how soil microbes thrive, under what conditions, and through the utilization of which resources, is a critical part of any assessment of ecosystem health and stability. Diatomic hydrogen is a byproduct of biological nitrogen fixation, an important process that contributes to soil nitrogen content, and is a nutrient for certain subsurface microbes. Consumption by microbes is the largest sink of atmospheric hydrogen, and the largest source of uncertainty in the global hydrogen budget. Identifying its production and consumption pathways, and how they are externally influenced, would inform our understanding of this important soil gas, and reveal new insights into the role of biological nitrogen fixation in biogeochemical nutrient cycling, soil health, and agricultural productivity. The concentration and isotopic signature of hydrogen are valuable indicators of the pathways responsible for its production and consumption in soil, however, in situ measurements of soil hydrogen are complicated by the large concentration gradients of hydrogen near nitrogen-fixing centers. This DOE Phase II SBIR proposal is aimed at continuing the design and development of a commercially viable system to map subsurface hydrogen and its isotopic signature by leveraging recent advances in soil gas sampling and well-established laser-based detection technologies. During Phase I a catalytic converter was developed that quantitatively converted hydrogen and its isotopes to water vapor, which was then readily detected using high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. The conversion system was coupled to soil gas probes buried in mesocosm columns containing agricultural soils. Testing of the compiled system successfully demonstrated quantitative recovery of soil hydrogen, and the ability to temporally resolve hydrogen production \u201chot moments\u201d. During Phase II the water isotope infrared analyzer will be modified for improved performance, including developing a heated absorption cell to minimize water-surface interactions. A commercial hydrogen converter package and an associated calibration system will be designed, built, and tested. The total soil hydrogen sampler will be tested and optimized in the laboratory, then field-deployed to an agricultural location to demonstrate real-world performance. The proposed system will enable new measurements of an important subsurface gas to refine nutrient cycling models, understand biological processes, and inform atmospheric budgets and models. This capability will be attractive to soil management and agricultural research markets due to the importance of hydrogen as a messenger of biological nitrogen fixation, a process that is crucial to sustainable agriculture practices. It will also find value in the academic and governmental soil research community, where the role of hydrogen in subsurface processes and its impact on ecosystem health and stability is actively being explored."

        "Abstract": "Solid-state quantum defects (e.g., single atomic defects and dopants in solids, semiconductor quantum dots, or organic molecules) play a central role in quantum information science and technology. The discovery, screening, and optimization of quantum defects and emitters are essential for America\u2019s global competitiveness. However, these goals are extremely challenging because of the lack of an integrated instrument for rapid quantum defect characterization of their full set of relevant physical parameters in a multimodal fashion. Advanced Research Systems (ARS) in collaboration with Professor Markus Raschke and Professor Shuo Sun (University of Colorado and JILA, Boulder) will develop a cryogenic quantum optical and spin probe station for high-throughput characterization of solid-state quantum defects. This instrument includes local probe imaging with atomic resolution, nano-optical and confocal spectroscopy, and spin resonance measurement. The instrument provides a new correlative approach and tool for rapid quantum defect spectroscopy, imaging, and screening. The instrument is enabled through an innovative approach by ARS based on the development of 4 K pneumatic drive Solvay cryocoolers and their techniques for decoupling the cryocooler cold head from the sample space using a helium exchange gas interface in combination with a new tabletop vibration isolation structure. During Phase I the tabletop vibration isolation prototype was designed, manufactured, and tested at ARS, then shipped to the University of Colorado for integration and testing with an atomic force microscope (AFM). The noise levels using the tabletop prototype matched those of a permanently anchored AFM benchmark system, paving the way for further development in Phase II. Additional Phase I accomplishments included setup and automation of far-field optical components, which will be integrated with the AFM\/near-field components in the proposed Phase II prototype. Phase II will focus on the development of a fully integrated quantum probe station for correlative and automated laser scanning, optical nano-probe, and spin resonance measurements at variable and cryogenic temperature. Automated realignment and measurement at variable temperature, magnetic field, and excitation wavelength will be developed. The Phase II goals are to demonstrate the quantum probe station performance for large-scale screening and discovery of solid-state quantum defects, leading to the commercialization of this system. The quantum probe station product will be manufactured and sold by ARS under the name \u201cAvalanche\u201d. It will feature automated test and measurement, data acquisition and processing, and real-time visualization. It will have a global market with wide range of customers in academia, national labs, and industry worldwide for a standardized, rapid, and facile characterization and discovery of quantum defect for quantum information science and technology. Beyond this specific target of quantum information applications, the instrument may be customized to find a broader market in materials science, conventional semiconductor device characterization, optoelectronic and photonic device manufacturing, single molecule spectroscopy, or polymer, thin film, and electrode interface characterization, i.e., advancing materials science where defects and associated structural heterogeneities play a crucial role controlling materials properties."

        "Abstract": "Ultrafast infrared laser systems have been proposed for many DOE, DOD and industrial applications. Currently available infrared femtosecond lasers are unstable, complicated, expensive to purchase and maintain, inefficient, and bulky. Fiber lasers are becoming the preferred option for kW-class ultrafast laser sources because of their inherent simplicity, small size, low cost, high efficiency, outstanding heat-dissipating properties, and excellent beam quality. NP Photonics proposes to develop a compact and robust single-polarization-state ultrafast fiber laser source at 2.1 \u00b5m with exceptional operation stability and reliability based on our substantial experience in developing ultrafast fiber lasers at 2 \u00b5m and our unique short-length highly doped fiber laser technology. This project is a continuation of the successful Phase I work by NP Photonics where we have demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed compact and robust ultrafast laser source by successfully developing a stable linearly polarized mode-locked Ho-doped fiber laser oscillator at 2.1 \u00b5m with polarization extinction ratio &gt; 25 dB, fabricating and testing Ho- doped fiber lasers pumped at 1950 nm, and demonstrating a 0.1 mJ all-fiber laser system at 2.1 \u00b5m. In Phase II, NP Photonics will focus on optimizing the mode-locked fiber laser oscillator, increasing the efficiency of Ho-doped fiber lasers, and developing a 5-mJ all-fiber ultrafast laser source at 2.1 \u00b5m. A compact and robust ultrafast laser prototype at 2.1 \u00b5m meeting or exceeding the requirements of the DOE\u2019s applications will be developed and delivered to the DOE laboratory at the end of Phase II. Dual use applications for the proposed high energy ultrafast lasers include directed energy weapons, material processing, the study of highly nonlinear processes in atoms and molecules, imaging and threat detection, and scientific research."

        "Abstract": "The fundamental limiting factor limiting Free Electron Lasers brightness is the electron source, or photoinjector. One solution to improve brightness is to use specifically shaped ultraviolet pulses to excite the photocathode, improving the electron cloud shape injected into the accelerator. Ultraviolet spatio-temporal ultrafast pulse measurement is needed to develop these pulse shapes. In this SBIR\/STTR, we will develop new methods for temporal and spatio-temporal measurement of ultraviolet ultrafast laser pulses to support the development of laser pumped ultra-bright electron sources. These techniques need to provide high fidelity measurements with high dynamic range and high spectral resolution to monitor and help design photocathode driving pulses. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of our proposed techniques for high spectral resolution and high dynamic range pulse measurement of deep-ultraviolet ultrafast laser pulses. We further demonstrated a combined spatio-temporal pulse electric field characterization in the near infrared that can be readily used in the ultraviolet. In Phase II, we will build and calibrate a prototype high fidelity, high dynamic range temporal pulse measurement system with ultra-fine spectral resolution. This device will be integrated into our spatio-temporal measurement to demonstrate full spatio-temporal pulse measurement for ultraviolet laser pulses. Our ultraviolet ultrafast laser pulse measurement technology will provide badly needed diagnostics in commercial markets. Deep ultraviolet ultrafast pulses are used in both scientific instruments and the semiconductor industry. This SBIR project will also develop new technologies for telecommunications applications."

        "Abstract": "Super-resolution imaging provides the ability to measure (i.e., resolve) objects that are smaller than the ~200 nanometer resolution limit of visible light. This can provide more detailed examinations into cellular metabolism and subcellular compartments, potentially leading to new advances in renewable energy production from microbial and plant sources. To date, however, super-resolution has been restricted to fixed (i.e., not living) samples processed in a particular manner, while single-molecule (SM) live imaging is possible only for very limited periods of time due to photodamage incurred by high-intensity illumination. Furthermore, out-of-focus light restricts the depth within a sample at which SM imaging can be performed. This SBIR\/STTR Phase II project aims to combine SM super-resolution microscopy with a patented Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) technology that enables the use of high-resolution objective lenses previously incompatible with LSFM. LSFM is both a more photon-efficient method of illumination (less photodamage) and an effective means of limiting out-of-focus light by only illuminating the in-focus specimen plane. While the technology that forms the basis of this proposal is the only LSFM technology that is natively compatible with the high-resolution lenses necessary for SM imaging, proper fluorophore behavior in SM imaging requires significantly more laser power than traditional LSFM demands. In order to achieve these higher powers, the Phase I project successfully re-engineered the illumination path to pair it with stronger lasers and generate a narrower light sheet, concentrating power previously wasted outside the field of view. The resulting prototype used a series of custom focusing mirrors and achieved SM imaging in live cells for an order of magnitude longer duration without phototoxicity, as well as super-resolution of fixed cells. The proposed Phase II work involves building an improved second-generation prototype, demonstrating the ability to achieve 3D dSTORM and 3D SM tracking, and building several prototypes to send to alpha users for data collection and user feedback. The illumination method of the resulting system will increase the longevity of samples, broaden compatibility of fluorophores with SM imaging (including low-abundance labels and metabolic probes), and enable super-resolution of structures deeper in cells, thereby opening up new experimental space for SM imaging."

        "Abstract": "Synchrotron light sources and x-ray free electron lasers are now generating shorter pulses with more intense light than ever before possible. The capabilities of these new sources grant unprecedented access into the workings of the natural world. Current x-ray detectors cannot accommodate the large dynamic range of collected x-rays in modern scattering experiments. Scientists are unable to answer fundamental questions largely due to this gap between synchrotron and x-ray detector technology. The proposed program will advance the development of a next-generation wide dynamic range x-ray mixed- mode pixel array detector. The first-generation of this mixed-mode detector was commercialized and has demonstrated single x-ray sensitivity with a dynamic range greater than 107 photons\/pixel with a frame rate of 1.1 kHz. This program enhances this existing technology by developing a new application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) with a ten-fold frame rate increase. In Phase I, the small business and collaborating university evaluated existing laboratory level ASIC technology and defined characteristics and design principles required for layout of a commercial product. This includes elements like radiation hardness and number of wirebonds. Phase I defined characteristics that will enable the ASIC to be packaged into a sensor with commercial vendors and maintain form factor with the first-generation commercial system mechanical and electrical components to expedite testing and bringing the technology to the market. The small business has also begun identifying elements of existing first-generation electronics that may require improvements to manage the enhanced second-generation performance features.In the proposed Phase II work, layout of a 16x16-pixel ASIC will be done in parallel with development of a test electronics setup to evaluate performance. After evaluation, a second small scale layout with design revisions will take place to further fine tune the ASIC. Repeat small scale testing has proven to weed out any potential design bugs while significantly mitigating risk in final, full 128x128-pixel layout. Testing will validate single photon detection ability, 10 kHz frame rate, and full well capacity of pixels. These are critical elements for advancing the detector technology to match existing synchrotron capabilities. A next generation, robust and commercially supported detector with the increased performance specifications will enable new x-ray scattering experiments to take full advantage of upgraded light sources. This will lead to higher resolution and sharper contrast diffraction patterns, and higher resolution structure determination. These advances will provide the user community with unparalleled resolution of data sets with even larger dynamic ranges, drastically improving scientist\u2019s ability to collect data, and allow greater insight into materials."

        "Abstract": "Statement of the Problem - The use of biofuels and waste coal has significant environmental\nbenefits, and it can contribute to promoting a low-carbon economy via hydrogen production.\nThese feedstocks can be cost effective, are readily available, and in the case of biofuels are\nrenewable with the near elimination of greenhouse gases. But there are issues with gasifying\nbiofuels and waste coal. The first one is the widely varying organic makeup and moisture content\nof the feedstock which makes optimization and proper control of the gasifier very challenging.\nThe second is the impact on the slag properties of the inert part of the fuel, affecting reactor\noperation and reliability.\nHow Problem Will be Solved - To solve these issues and therefore take full advantage of these\nfeedstocks, the project team propose to develop machine learning (ML) enhanced diagnostics to\nenable gasifiers to process waste coal and biofuels optimally and economically; thus, avoiding\nthem from being landfilled and taking advantage of their value and favorable environmental\nproperties. Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) along with the use of advanced ML\nsignal processing can accurately measure important properties of the feedstock such as proximate\nand ultimate analyses, including moisture and ash content, elemental concentrations, heating\nvalue, and ash slagging temperatures.\nIn a proposed system to be developed in this project, a laser beam is directed onto the raw\nfeedstock moving on the feed conveyor belt prior to going to the gasifier. The laser vaporizes\nand ionizes micrograms of the feedstock. The resulting emitted radiation is collected by a\nspectrometer which records the wavelength and the intensity of the radiation. The wavelengths\nuniquely identify each element in the feedstock and the intensities are proportional to their\nconcentrations. Next, ML processes the LIBS raw spectra and accurately determines the\nfeedstock properties of interest. This includes higher order properties of the fuel such as heating\nvalue and ash slagging temperatures. Further, and most importantly, the measurement is made\ncontinually and in situ, thus allowing near real time input that would enable feed-forward control\nof the entire gasification process.\nWhat is to be Done in Phase I - In Phase I the project team will conduct laboratory tests on\nwaste coals and biofuels, and process the data with ML to determine the instrument&apos;s capabilities\nand operating envelop. The team members and other stakeholders will evaluate the results and\nfrom this we will make a Go\/No Go decision about submitting a Phase II proposal.\nCommercial Applications - The commercial focus of this project is for the instrument to be\nused at gasifiers which will provide real time data on their feedstock and allow them to better\ncontrol their operation and optimize their performance. Other markets include the coal-fired\npower plant, and MSW and biofuel processing facilities."

Delivering ultrashort pulses in the mid-IR spectral region (l &gt;3 \u00b5m) has however so\nfar been possible via frequency down-conversion schemes that are typically bulky, lossy, and\nenvironment sensitive. There is however a great need for sources of stable, compact and turn-key\nultrashort pulses in the mid-IR for a wide variety of applications ranging from spectroscopy of\ngases for industrial environment monitoring, spectroscopy of the next generation of quantum\ninformation materials, or to drive secondary sources such as e-beams relying on dielectric laser\naccelerators (DLA) or coherent soft X-rays based on high harmonic generation (HHG).\nIn phase I of this project we will demonstrate a stable mid-IR platform that will deliver\nfemtosecond pulses at 100 MHz repetition rate, sub-nJ to nJ energy at both 3 \u00b5m and 2 \u00b5m\nwavelength. Owing to the time and budget limitations of Phase I, the 3 \u00b5m pulses will be generated\nin a combined fiber\/free space setting that will be used to design an all-fiber architecture. In phase\nII, the designed all-fiber approach will be implemented and the pulses at 2 \u00b5m and 3 \u00b5m\nwavelength will be scaled to the mJ energy level at kHz repetition rate.\nThe system developed in phase I would find applications in mid-IR spectroscopy providing\naccess \u2013 from a single box \u2013 to two long-wavelength spectral bands in a turn-key and robust\narchitecture that can further be turned into a frequency comb. In addition, with limited further\ndevelopment, the energy of the 2 \u00b5m wave could be scaled and allow parametric amplification of\nthe 3 \u00b5m wave, thereby producing an ultrabroadband 6 \u00b5m wave, precisely in the spectral range\nof rovibrational absorption band for a wide range of molecules. Further, the system delivered in\nPhase I would also make an ideal seed laser for 3 \u00b5m OPCPAs, an ideal driver for a secondary\nsource of coherent soft x-ray radiation (200-1200 eV photon energy). Such secondary source\nwould in turn allow spectroscopy on technologically relevant magnetic material and alloys with\nabsorption in the 600-900 eV range, diffractive imaging with sub-5 nm resolution, a resolution\nrange of high importance for the inspection of photolithography masks, or seed FELs.."

        "Abstract": "Superconducting magnets, by offering extremely strong magnetic fields, play a key role for high energy physics explorations. However, magnet quenches due to thermal disturbances, significantly suppress magnet performance, and substantially add to the operating cost of superconducting magnets by boiling away huge amounts of extraordinarily expensive liquid helium. Low temperature superconducting can often require dozens of quenches to train the magnet before reaching their design field target. Not to mention that in some cases, an unexpected quench could destroy a millions-of-dollars magnet system.\nAn innovative diagnostic system will be developed in this STTR project to exclude thermal disturbance resources by identifying and localizing magnet defects before magnet cooling, to protect magnet from quench damage by monitoring magnet mechanical structures during magnet operation, and to improve the understanding of magnet training or degradation mechanisms by non-destructive post-operation scanning. The proposed system will utilize laser to generate and sense ultrasound as a non-destructive detection tool to interrogate superconducting magnet to map defect structures within magnets. The proposed laser-ultrasonic imaging technology possesses the advantages of low cost, nonionic nature, and portability over x-ray computed chromograph\nDeveloping an industrial laser-ultrasound system specifically for NDT analysis in superconducting magnet is the overall technical goal for this STTR project. In the phase I effort, the feasibility of laser-ultrasound technology for NDT in superconducting magnets will be demonstrated. Considering the time and budget constriction, Phase I work will focus on feasibility demonstration of using laser source to generate ultrasound that meets high energy physics applications, under the guidance of model simulation and the understanding of photoacoustic effect. The development of laser detector is not included because of the exclusively expensive parts and less technical challenge. And it will be integrated in Phase II effort. Another key task of Phase II work is to integrate laser-ultrasound scanning system into superconducting magnet to monitor magnet running at cryogenic temperatures.\nAfter completing this project, an advanced laser-ultrasonic system will be available for high energy physics applications, and it will also benefit to medical diagnosis, public transportation, fusion energy, and very high field magnet communities."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is the facilitation of more widespread and affordable wildlife research, management, and monitoring through the use of internet-connected devices. Internet-mediated human control of laser hazing devices may provide cost-effective damage reduction in agricultural settings. The research is founded on the ability of lasers to repel a wide variety of birds. Human oversight will benefit from remote operation, allowing the research and development activtities to be conducted at a fraction of the cost of an on-site presence. The immediate problem addressed is avian damage. agricultural losses, predation on sensitive species, and aviation hazards.Refining and expanding the proposed model may broaden the range of solvable conservation problems. The proposed system seeks to allow one person to simultaneously operate multiple internet connected devices. The creation of reliable, remote management tools may broaden the scope and improve the efficiency of natural resource management. By allowing remote wildland views and providing opportunities for positive intervention, the technology may increase public engagement with the natural world through formal and informal education, improve the understanding of resource protection issues, and enhance public commitment to solving environmental challenges.The development of a fully integrated, remotely-operable network of internet-connected, artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced laser devices for repelling pest birds from valuable agricultural assets is proposed. The primary project goal of the project is to make non-lethal pest bird management more effective, easy, and affordable in agricultural, conservation, and commercial settings that are often remote. Phase 1 research and development will cover the creation and initial field testing of a laser array that is remotely controlled by internet connected operators. Phase 1 performance metrics will focus on reliability and ease of use as there are significant operational challenges in various settings (e.g., lack of wi-fi connectivity in wilderness and remote locations, laser safety, etc.).The project seeks to establish a template for the reliable, remote operation of a wide array of human-controlled devices via internet connections supplemented, where appropriate, with artificial intelligence. This technology may facilitate the wide adoption of more efficient approaches to wildland research, monitoring, and management as the physical presence of the operator will not be required.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Michigan Aerospace proposes to retrofit the Egret LIDAR technology to improve operation stormwater management infrastructure. The Egret LIDAR is a novel sensor that can monitor stormwater without submersion. Using LIDAR remote sensing, the Egret can measure turbidity, surface height, water depth, flow speed, and suspended particle sizes from above the water surface. The Egret measures water properties by analyzing images of multiple laser beams as they propagate down into the water from above the surface. Use of low-cost cameras and diode lasers allows the Egret to be simple in design, low in cost, and be able to operate in remote locations from battery or solar power. Not requiring submersion removes issues of biofouling and difficult installation\/maintenance typically associated with in situ sensors. Making multiple measurements from a single platform also reduces costs and number of data sources a stormwater system manager needs to monitor. The Egret sensor can provide continuous monitoring of retention ponds, reporting its measurements wirelessly to infrastructure management software. This data can be used, for example, to implement closed loop control on retention pond drains, thereby optimizing their performance and reducing the amounts of sediments\/contaminants entering habitats downstream. The commercial potential of the Egret sensor is significant. Open water monitoring sensors for turbiditiy, bathymetry, and flow speed in North America in 2020 represents a market of 130,000 sensors and a market size of $235 million. Most of these sensors need replacing every five years due to wear and tear from continuous submersion. The Egret sensor has disruptive potential within this sensor market due to its novel ability to make its measurements from above the water surface without any submerged components to foul or interrupt water flow. The high turnover rate of existing sensors also means that, if embraced as a viable alternative to current sensors, the Egret can replace a significant fraction of all existing equivalent submerged sensors within a 10-year time frame. Previous efforts under a similar DOE SBIR effort have demonstrated proof of concept of the LIDAR sensing method under laboratory and outdoor conditions. The Egret is now in need of long-term field validation in relevant environments to demonstrate its ability as a novel low-cost sensing tool for various applications, such as stormwater infrastructure monitoring. The proposed Phase I effort will test the sensor&apos;s potential to provide closed-loop control data on a retention pond along EPA regulated Malletts Creek in Ann Arbor, Michigan."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve distal extremity joint arthroplasty.Arthroplasty is a surgical procedure to restore the function of a joint.The proposed technology replaces cold knife, electrocautery, orthopedic saws and drills with a hand-held, all-tissue laser ablation system that fast cuts bone without necrosis. The effect is to reduce surgical time, create more precise cuts and drill holes, decrease recovery times, and reduce the need for opioid medications after surgery. The integrated visualization system may allow orthopedic surgeons to perform precise surgical planning that is difficult or impossible with current methods. While important in hips or knees, surgical precision is critical in wrists, ankles, and fingers\/toes. The proposed device produced in this project may improve surgical success rates and reduce complications and revision surgeries, which will reduce patient suffering and excess healthcare costs. At the same time, the proposed tools may enable safe and successful distal extremity joint arthroplasty to be performed routinely.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop an all-tissue laser-based orthopedic surgery system that integrates cameras for real-time, three-dimensional (3D) vision within a single handpiece. Conventional saws and drills compress and shear bones, causing postoperative joint pain and prolonging recovery times. A laser cuts by ablating tissue at its specific molecular absorption without killing the surrounding tissue (i.e., necrosis). One critical technical innovation in this project is to use a pulsed, high peak power, 9.3m wavelength carbon dioxide (CO2) laser that rapidly ablates hydroxyapatite (bone) and water (soft tissue). The laser pulse widths are chosen to approach the tissue\u2019s Thermal Relaxation Time, TRT, which eliminates necrosis. Another critical technical innovation is to integrate various cameras (similar to smartphone and confocal microscope cameras) within the 9.3m ablation laser pulse train to provide real-time, high-definition, intraoperative vision. The proposed device may be enhanced to demonstrate sufficiently large bone ablation patterns, clinically acceptable bone ablation speeds, and non-tapered laser drilling tapering. The instrument will be housed in a handheld device that mimics existing orthopedic tools and will be run by firmware to perform at speeds necessary for clinical use.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the next decade, mankind will launch more objects into orbit than have launched in the entire history of space exploration. Current systems are not adequately equipped to manage the increased traffic and collision avoidance models need better data to scale. There are no unambiguous, persistent, and low-cost means to identify, track, and troubleshoot assets launched into orbit. The proposed system would fill this gap by making it easy and simple for customers to be good stewards of the orbital domain and enable fail-safe communications with a satellite. The proposed system would significantly increase the quality of space data to help avoid collisions and prevent unnecessary \u201cspace junk\u201d due to an inability to identify newly-launched assets.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to fill the capability gap of current systems to support the explosive growth of the space economy by building a laser beacon that is a space orbit tracking unit. Current beacon systems rely on radio frequency communications, which are too bulky for small satellites, contribute to interference problems, and require a license from governing agencies. The proposed solution bypasses the limitations of the state-of-the-art by using a low-power optical signal. This signal is sent from a tiny device compatible with small satellites which makes adoption simple for the predominant form-factor on orbit. Research goals include miniaturization of the electronic systems, modeling the optical link between beacon and detector, and determining optimal configuration for the power supply\/generation so the beacon does not draw host resources.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Free-Electron Laser (FEL) x-ray sources are continuously being improved and upgraded, opening the doors for many scientific frontiers in biology, chemistry, and material science, such as structural dynamics, matter at extreme conditions and nanostructure imaging. However, the lack of suitable ultrafast sources and detectors covering X-rays to Vis-NIR has been preventing\/limiting such studies in the past. The Hamamatsu G4176-03 ultrafast Metal-Semiconductor-Metal (MSM) photodetector, which is low temperature-GaAs-based, is a potential solution, but was recently discontinued. A replacement with equivalent or better performance is thus needed, as currently called for by the DOE. The need for ultrafast detectors is being addressed by developing a picosecond photodetector based on our in-house grown Cadmium Magnesium Telluride (Cd1-xMgxTe) single crystal. CdMgTe is sensitive to both optical and x-ray pulses for coarse timing in FEL applications. A CdMgTe-based photodetector has the potential of exhibiting better detector performance than the Hamamatsu G4176-03 ultra-fast MSM Photodetector, while having similar form factor\/packaging. A CdMgTe photodetector with better performance than the Hamamatsu G4176-03 photodiode was demonstrated. The 2-3 ps photo-response has been shown via femto-second laser pump-probe measurement. The current (dark and light) levels of the CdMgTe device was much smaller, more linear and more stable compared to the Hamamatsu reference. A prototype device using an initial R&amp;D electrode pattern (for signal collection) and an SMA connector (same connector used in the Hamamatsu G4174-03) was built and has been sent for further X-ray ultrafast response measurements. In Phase II we will fully demonstrate the advantageous features of our ultrafast CdMgTe photodetector using an improved device design with the interdigitated electrode pattern and same form factor\/packaging as the Hamamatsu G4176-03 device. The proposed device will have the additional transmission mode capability via a 3-terminal device configuration (The Hamamatsu G4176-03 can only be operated in reflective mode with the 2-terminal device). We will demonstrate a prototype picosecond photodetector based on Cd1-xMgxTe that is sensitive to both optical and x-ray pulses for coarse timing in FEL applications. Applications that rely on ultrafast timing of FELs, such as femtosecond X-ray\/optical cross-correlation diagnostics, will benefit, especially in biology, chemistry and material science. At this time, ultrafast Cd1-xMgxTe photodetector materials are not available commercially. There is a tremendous potential for widespread commercialization of the materials and devices that will be developed during this program, including various applications in the nuclear radiation detection field. We hope to develop a domestic source for this material as an alternative to the high cost, conventional cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) radiation detection material."

        "Abstract": "Future high-impact scientific applications at synchrotron and Free-Electron Laser (FEL) X-ray sources require the development of processing and mounting methods for ultra-thin diamond crystals to meet the most challenging needs of pioneering research at next generation light source facilities. These methods should be capable of manufacturing crystal plates as thin as 10 micrometers over an area of a few mm2, and with a surface cut in different crystal orientations, such as the diamond (100), (111), (110), etc. Great Lakes Crystal Technologies (GLCT) is partnered with Stony Brook University (SUNY) to develop the technology for creating ultra-thin diamond drumhead crystals in customer- desired crystallographic orientations including (100), (111), and (110) directions. GLCT will obtain high quality (100) diamond plates, verify their structural quality via x- ray diffraction analysis, then divide and thin them into 2 @ 50 micron thick plates using a laser cutting process, then polish their top and bottom surfaces to = 1 nm surface RMS, and then seek to thin them in the central few square millimeters area to = 10 microns thickness by applying advanced RIE processing at SUNY, and applying engineering advances along the way towards the goal of creating a high quality drumhead crystals, which will be sent to SLAC for testing and analysis for their performance as an x-ray beam splitter. The proposed technology will benefit advanced x-ray science performed at SLAC and the 70+ additional advanced beamlines around the world. There are also a number of medical and homeland security applications which could benefit from the technology."

The difficulty of a scalable method for fabricating on-chip, multi-color lasers is a major challenge for the silicon photonics market. Specifically, today&apos;s standard manufacturing of photonic chips does not include on-chip lasers. Without integration of laser engines to drive the circuits, the market potential of light chips is constrained by design and price. The technology developed here can allow foundries to mass produce chips with lasers and open multiple new markets for silicon photonics including wearable photonic sensors, optical data transfer, autonomous vehicle light detection and ranging, quantum information, fiber-optic gyroscopes, and healthcare applications such as immunoassay tests and medical imaging.This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project develops on-chip embedded lasers to enable fully functional silicon photonic chip manufacturing. Currently, the laser solutions being employed in silicon photonics include bonded lasers and heterogeneous integration. The system integrators that assemble silicon photonics modules rely on often cumbersome methods of gluing individual lasers to silicon chips, keeping costs high and throughput well below desired levels. The photonic inks developed here will overcome this challenge by enabling an in-foundry laser solution via wafer-scale additive manufacturing. The photonic ink emits broad-spectrum light covering the visible to the near-infrared range and can be tailored to emit at specific wavelength bands relevant to different markets by altering the number of atomic layers. The goals of this Phase I project are to demonstrate electroluminescence from a p-n junction made from doped, few-layer nanomaterials.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The broader benefit for society is to reduce death or permanent disability from ischemic stroke with its resultant family, community, and economic burden.This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will lead to the development of a medical device to enable efficient removal of blood clots from the brain arteries of a stroke victim.The platform technology is constructed from microscopic tubes of superelastic metal alloy integrated with a proprietary pattern of laser-cut apertures.The device can be delivered to the stroke clot through a microcatheter to create a shape-formed array of clot-capture elements within a patient\u2019s artery.Tandem capture devices optimize the clot capture system and can be positioned on either edge of a clotted segment within a brain artery. Optimal shape, thickness and materials of the clot capture elements and the delivery system will be characterized, developed, and verified.The proposed work will utilize a previously validated model of stroke thrombectomy to characterize and quantify fundamental clot capture parameters (clot stabilization, retention, and retrieval) among multiple discrete capture node embodiments.Radial force, coefficient of drag during withdrawal inside a cerebral blood vessel and device trackability will be measured for each design using robust three-dimensional human anatomic models of cerebral vessels. The project will enable a design freeze of the optimal device design and validate its performance using a preclinical animal model.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

PCSEL offers the combined attributes of conventional lasers with demonstrated high-power, single-mode operations from large apertures. To address the cavity scaling challenges in high speed PCSELs with aperture sizes down to a few micrometers, a novel lateral cavity confinement configuration is proposed. Such a lateral confinement configuration can offer both strong optical confinement and compact lateral charge confinement for increased intrinsic modulation speed and reduced parasitic effects. The trade-offs between the modulation speed and optical power will be investigated. Vertical cavity feedbacks will also be incorporated and optimized for photon lifetime management. The objective of this project is to investigate different optical feedback configurations in the PCSEL cavities to scale the cavity sizes down to a few micrometers with the goal of single-mode, high power, and high-speed operation.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Summary\nOur goal is to commercialize interstitial chemo-phototherapy (I-CPT) as a new therapeutic option for locally\nadvanced liver cancers. Doxorubicin (Dox) can be actively loaded into long circulating, serum-stable, porphyrin-\nphospholipid (PoP) liposomes and be released with 665-nm laser light (PhotoDox). This approach leads to vastly\nenhanced drug accumulation in irradiated tissues, resulting in ultrapotent tumor ablation. In the phase I STTR,\nwe employed this dosimetry-treatment planning platform to guide light administration of I-CPT with PhotoDox.\nWe demonstrated that this treatment planning with light dosimetry is effective in ablating large orthotopic\nhepatocellular carcinoma tumors in rats. In this phase II STTR application we propose to further advance I-CPT\nwith PhotoDox towards an IND for enabling future clinical studies. To that end we propose to complete the\nfollowing aims: Aim 1: Optimizing I-CPT with PhotoDox for a durable complete response of large spontaneous\nhepatocellular carcinoma in a woodchuck model. The woodchuck model is the largest experimental animal model\nwith spontaneous locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the context of chronic viral hepatitis and\nliver cancer, as seen in people with hepatitis B. In pilot studies, we have safely dosed PhotoDox to woodchucks,\nconfirmed the characteristic long-circulating nature of PhotoDox and applied the FEM based treatment planning\nand dosimetry to safely treat HCC (~50 cm3) with I-CPT in woodchucks. We will address the key question: What\nare the optimal light settings for I-CPT with PhotoDox in the treatment of large HCC? Aim 2: Generate IND-\nenabling data on the toxicity of I-CPT with PhotoDox. POP BIO has previously generated non-GLP toxicity data\nof PhotoDox in rats including cursory establishment of the maximum tolerated dose. Since then, POP BIO has\nheld a pre-IND meeting with the FDA, who confirmed the suitability of the 505(b)(2) route for components of\nPhotoDox and provided guidance about the required toxicological studies required prior to first-in-human studies.\nWe will address the key question: What is the toxicity of PhotoDox under GLP studies? This translational Phase\nII project will provide required data for an IND submission to the FDA by providing valuable relevant to\nunderstanding I-CPT treatment in the context of human liver cancer patients. If successful, I-CPT with PhotoDox\nstands to benefit the majority of new liver cancer patients, who have inoperable and problematic primary tumors.Narrative\nPatients with inoperable locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have a 5-year survival rate of just\n31%. The goal of this proposal is to advance a novel interstitial chemo-phototherapy (I-CPT) that combines\nPhotoDox, a light-activated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, with MRI treatment planning developed by PI\nto provide a potent therapeutic option for locally advanced HCC. This will be accomplished by: optimizing I-CPT\nwith PhotoDox for a durable complete response of large spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma in a woodchuck\nmodel; and generating IND-enabling data on the toxicity of I-CPT with PhotoDox in two animal species (rat and\ndog)."

        "Abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY\/ABSTRACT\nNeonatal encephalopathy can arise from fetal hypoxia-ischemia during labor, chronic uteroplacental\ninflammation, and large cerebral artery embolization primarily arising from dislodgement of a placental thrombus.\nBecause of overlapping clinical presentation, differential diagnosis is often delayed until seizures develop and\nMRI can be safely performed, a time at which most neuroprotectants are ineffective. Whereas hypothermia is\napproved for use within 6 hours of birth for hypoxia-ischemia, no treatments have been approved for perinatal\narterial ischemic stroke because of the difficulty of definitive diagnosis required for clinical trial stratification at\nbirth. With an estimated incidence of 17-93 per 100,000 live births, the incidence of stroke in the perinatal period\nrivals the incidence of stroke in adults (17-23 per 100,000). Therefore, a device that could rapidly and reliably\nidentify an area of focal cerebral ischemia soon after birth would have a major impact by enabling the testing of\nneuroprotectants at an early therapeutic time window that would maximize efficacy. The Brimrose Technology\nCorporation, partnering with Johns Hopkins University, propose a photoacoustic helmet (PAH) device that can\nbe safely deployed at the bedside in the neonatal intensive care unit to 1) continuously monitor and rapidly\nidentify at-risk neonates, shortly after birth, rapidly allowing them to be triaged to therapy; 2) monitor the progress\nof therapy; and 3) provide prognostic information to the parents of newborns at risk for life-long brain injury. The\nPA imaging mechanism is a purely hybrid mechanism, providing rich optical absorbance contrast of tissue oxy-\nand deoxyhemoglobin through intact scalp and skull. A proof-of-concept of detecting decreased tissue\noxyhemoglobin in a 1 cm-induced experimental stroke has been demonstrated with standard laboratory PA laser\nlight source and clinical ultrasound detector. Our goal is to incorporate safer light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and\nmore sensitive ultrasound detectors configured in a neonatal helmet to localize cortical regions of low\noxygenation in the newborn. In the proposed Phase-I STTR, we will develop fundamental hardware and software\ncomponents for effective integration. Aim 1 - Software for safe PAH imaging at high contrast resolution, including\ndeep neural network and optimal spectral unmixing techniques to enable a safe and high-speed LED-based PAH\nsystem. Aim 2 - Hardware for modular PAH system, including a fiber-coupled Brimrose ultra-sensitive multi-\nbounce laser microphone and optimal modular unit design for a PAH imaging at high spatial-temporal-spectral\nresolution through intact scalp and skull. Aim 3 - Framework for modular PAH system integration, enabling a\nrobust integration of modular units in a PAH system with rigid-body tag registration using optical tracking, in\nwhich different neonatal head shapes and need for different imaging specifications can be accommodated. The\nPhase-I milestone is detection of the full blood O2 saturation range at andlt;10 mm full-width-half-maximum in the\ntransverse plane and 5 mm sensing depth through ex vivo neonatal piglet skull + scalp sample with an integrated\nset of hardware and software packages, allowing preclinical validation studies to proceed in Phase II.PROJECT NARRATIVE\nThe Brimrose Technology Corporation, partnering with Johns Hopkins University, propose a new brain\nmonitoring device for continuous monitoring of vulnerable neonates in intensive care unit to enable differential\ndiagnosis of early ischemic stroke and minimize the developmental disability. In this STTR phase I project, our\ngoal is to develop fundamental hardware and software packages for modular photoacoustic helmet technology,\nproviding high transcranial sensitivity and spatial resolution of brain regions of low oxygenation by integrating\nBrimrose multi-bounce laser microphone, safe pulsed light-emitting diode, and modular integration technologies.\nSuch continuous and safe monitoring of vulnerable neonatal brain will provide valuable information for effective\ntreatment planning, therapeutic monitoring, and prognosis to minimize life-long neurologic injury."

        "Abstract": "Project Summary\/Abstract: Respiratory viruses are among the most serious threats to global public health, in\npart due to the limitations of currently commercially available tests: the high cost and time-consuming nature of\nlab-based tests, as well as the comparatively lower sensitivity and specificity of point-of-care (PoC) tests. There\nis a significant need for a rapid, portable, and inexpensive testing capability that is both highly sensitive and\nspecific. The broad, long-term objective of this project is the development of a highly sensitive viral diagnostic\ntest employing Avsana Labs\u2019 digital plasmonic nanobubble (digital PNB) counting technology for detection of\nRSV, a globally significant virus selected for proof-of-concept studies. The viral test device implements sensing\nof virus particles by means of their attachment to antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticles, employing laser beams\nco-aligned in an optical fiber to generate nanobubbles from gold nanoparticles in a digital format (presence or\nabsence of large nanobubbles) with the use of a microfluidic chip. The test will feature a rapid test turnaround\ntime, high sensitivity and specificity, low cost, portability, and ease of use that will make it suitable for the PoC,\nincluding low-resource settings. Aim 1: Develop alpha-prototype platform for dPNB assay, demonstrating\nportability andamp; functionality. In a related R01 study, the assay is realized using a laboratory setup. This aim will\nfocus on miniaturizing optics and electronics from the lab setup into a benchtop-portable device as an alpha-\nprototype of a PoC platform, which would incorporate all the necessary signal processing around the detection\nmechanism, enabling a low-cost self-contained solution. Aim 2: Optimize the assay workflow and chemistry\nfor intact RSV virus detection in clinical specimen matrix. The goal is to establish a robust assay workflow\nand chemistry to detect intact viruses in de-identified nasopharyngeal swab samples, in order to integrate with\nthe alpha-prototype from Aim 1 and advance the technology toward a reliable diagnostic test for use in the clinic.\nAim 3: Test the sensitivity and specificity of the dPNB assay with a pilot cohort of de-identified clinical\ncontaining RSV and Influenza type A specimens using the alpha-prototype. An important milestone towards\ncommercialization is to establish early-on the ability to detect viruses in clinical specimens. We will test a small\ncohort of 60 de-identified clinical specimens, and use the original laboratory setup for reference. Societal\nbenefits and broader impact on public health will be found in rapid and accurate in vitro viral pathogen\ndiagnosis. Avsana envisions that the PNB platform will benefit the management of seasonal respiratory and\nemerging viral infections, and that additionally, it will accelerate the pandemic response and reduce the loss of\nlives in the likely event of future viral pandemics.Rapid Viral Diagnostic Test by Digital Plasmonic NanobubblesProject Narrative\nIn this Phase I STTR project, Avsana Labs and its academic partners will develop a rapid viral diagnostic\ntest platform employing an innovative digital plasmonic nanobubble technology.\nThe broad, long-term objective of this project is to develop a rapid, highly sensitive and specific, low-\ncost viral pathogen detection platform, for infectious disease point-of-care (PoC) diagnostic use, as well\nas for applications in biomedical research.\nSocietal benefits and a broader impact on public health will be found in a rapid, accurate, and\ninexpensive in vitro diagnostic capability, providing early detection and cost-effective widely available\npopulation testing, in addition to reducing the loss of life in the likely event of viral pandemics and\nendemics."

        "Abstract": "Abstract -\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects an estimated 6.2 million\nAmericans and the 6th leading cause of death in the U.S. AD is progressive and incurable; dementia symptoms\ngradually worsen over a number of years. In its early stages, memory loss is mild, but in late-stage AD, individuals\nlose the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to their environment. AD is a devastating condition that\ncreates vast emotional, financial, and physical challenges for the person and their family. In AD, pathological\nchanges may arise up to 20 years before the onset of dementia, providing a unique window of opportunity\nfor interventions aimed at preserving cognitive health and delaying disease progression. However, there is\ncurrently no diagnostic tool that can be widely applied for the detection of preclinical AD. When potentially\neffective therapies are initiated late in the underlying disease pathology process (i.e., after cognitive decline is\napparent), the true impact of prevention is not achieved. In response to the critical need for an accessible\ndiagnostic tool for early and preclinical AD, Early Alzheimer\u2019s Diagnostics proposes to develop a screening\ntechnology based on Raman Spectroscopy combined with machine learning (ML) models trained to\ndetect spectral signature changes based on the contribution of multiple biomarkers found in the blood.\nThe proposed technology has the potential to greatly improve outcomes by allowing patients to identify early\nsigns of AD, and therefore start preventive interventions and active monitoring of disease progression, delaying\nthe onset of dementia, and preserving brain health for longer. Such a tool would also have significant utility in\nclinical trials for critically needed new AD therapies, facilitating recruitment and selection of healthy volunteers\nand AD patients at various stages of disease progression. Preliminary results show that the approach can\ndifferentiate the biochemical composition of blood from patients at different stages of AD from healthy controls.\nThe team has also developed a novel method using automated mapping of solid samples to detect ultra-small\namounts of biomarkers by preventing them from leaving a small volume interrogated by the focused laser light\nduring spectral acquisition. This Phase I project will provide de-risk key aspects in the process of adapting the\ntechnology into a clinical commercial application and provide proof-of-feasibility via a blind test. The Specific\nAims of this STTR project are: 1) Optimize a scalable, rapid methodology for obtaining and analyzing Raman\nspectral data from blood serum; 2) Develop ML algorithm approaches for analyzing Raman spectral data; and\n3) Validate the Raman spectroscopy-based approach in a blind test. Successful completion of proposed research\nwill position Early Alzheimer\u2019s Diagnostics to perform initial clinical trials in Phase II, and advance discussions\nwith potential industry partners to establish partnerships to develop the proposed approach into either a stand-\nalone diagnostic test or possible companion diagnostic.Narrative -\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is a progressive, incurable neurodegenerative disorder, and its pathology begins many\nyears before symptoms emerge, underscoring the importance of early diagnostics. Early Alzheimer\u2019s Diagnostics\nproposes to develop a Raman spectroscopy-based diagnostic tool for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, based on a minimally\ninvasive blood test. Early Alzheimer\u2019s Diagnostics has the potential to dramatically improve outcomes by allowing\npatients to start treatment with disease-modifying therapies years earlier than what is currently possible."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve patient outcomes through non-invasive nasal drug delivery. The nasal cavity is a non-invasive drug delivery conduit that is rapid-acting and inexpensive. Topical intranasal medications treat sinus-nasal, neurologic, and systemic diseases. The proposed innovation will significantly improve nasal drug delivery and patient outcomes by getting medication exactly where it needs to go. It will be the first miniaturized atomization technology and can be broadly applied to other fields. The initial envisioned application is chronic sinusitis, which affects 10% of the population and costs US healthcare $12 billion\/year.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances a new nasal drug delivery system.Current topical drug deliveries have limited effectiveness because they rely on distant particle atomization through complex nasal anatomy. To overcome this, a self-administered, catheter-based atomization drug delivery device that delivers drug directly to the anatomic target will be developed. However, atomization only exists in larger, rigid form factors. The objective of this research is to develop an novel atomizer that maintains a small, flexible form factor to be incorporated into the catheter tip. A new system like this is crucial for effective, tolerable nasal drug delivery. Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations will be performed to determine prototype design and construction. Designs will be manufactured through micromolding, extrusion manipulation, and overmolding with micro-3D printing. Designs will be tested using laser diffraction to evaluate spray characteristics (droplet size distribution, spray angle, velocity, and plume geometry) and anatomic models to evaluate fluid deposition.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Surgical resection is required in approximately 80% of cancers presenting solid tumors. Despite advancing technologies, countries categorized as LMICs show an increase in incidences of various cancers. The lack of preventative screenings, and the associated infrastructure, make both identification and screening of cancers difficult. The long-term objective of this work is to build a benchtop CO2 laser system for testing on tissue-mimicking material, for the purpose of applying this system for treating oral, cervical, and colorectal cancers in LMICs. Laser ablation of tumors and photothermal coagulation of tissue speeds surgery, while helping to decrease positive margins when compared to surgery with traditional tools, and decreases bleeding and healing times. Identification of tumors can be done by eye and aided by fluorescent probes. In this work, a Zemax optical software model will be created to determine optimal lens assembly of the laser vision system, then a benchtop version of the system will be constructed. Finally, the laser vision system will be tested on ballistic gel injected with various fluorophores applied in fluorescent-guided surgery of cancer. The final laser system will run only on electricity, have wheels, and include exchangeable handpieces for ergonomic resection of all three cancer types mentioned above."

        "Abstract": "Problem Statement:\nTerahertz radiation is emerging as a valuable portion of the electromagnetic spectrum for imaging with important applications in medicine, security, defense, manufacturing, scientific research, and is a leading technology for \u201c6G\u201d wireless networking. The traditional multi-step lithography-based approach for manufacturing THz filters is expensive and limited to diameters of 30 cm. However, lower cost, high quality THz filters of arbitrary size are required for many applications, including the CMB-S4 program.\nHow this Problem Will Be Addressed:\nThe proposed technology is a rapid, low-cost fabrication method for multi-layer, metal-mesh THz filters that will produce these filters using a direct-write approach at a lower cost, in higher volumes, and with arbitrarily large diameters.\nWhat was Done in Phase I:\nThe Phase I project experimentally demonstrated that this new fabrication technology has the ability to create the microstructures necessary for these filters and demonstrated a single-layer THz filter during the project. The fabrication technology can also create other structures, similar to the microstructures in THz filters, that are desired by potential industrial customers.\nWhat is Planned for the Phase II Project:\nThe Phase II project will develop a complete large-area, nano-laser-ablation tool for filters along with supporting capabilities of filter design and testing to provide custom fabricated multi-level metal mesh filters for a variety of THz applications.\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits If Carried Over to Phase II:\nCommercial applications for the proposed high-performance filters include THz imaging, spectroscopy, and wireless communications. These applications would benefit industries such as medicine, homeland security and defense, consumer devices, food safety, non-destructive evaluation for manufacturing, and scientific research. The nano-ablation capability will also be broadly useful as a rapid microfabrication tool that would be useful in microsystems, optics, integrated circuits, and circuit board production."

QDEL devices can be an effective aPDT light source without those limitations.

        "Abstract": "High intensity light sources can be effectively used for Infrared Countermeasures (IRCM) against Electrooptic (EO) based systems. The operational requirements for an IRCM optical source depend upon the desired effects along with engagement parameters such as range, atmospheric conditions, engagement geometry, target characteristics, and IRCM platform constraints. Of interest, are systems that can &quot;dazzle\u201d or damage EO sensors with ultrashort laser pulses with spectral content that spans the mid-infrared (MWIR) or long-wave infrared (LWIR) spectral regions, because it is difficult to protect sensors from this type of counter measure with passive filters or active optical limiters. The objectives of the proposed Phase I effort is to use numerical simulations and IRCM-system considerations to model several new approaches for delivery of ultra-broadband IR laser pulses to EO sensors, select an approach, define top-level system requirements, and produce a preliminary design for an optical source for prototyping in a Phase II program."

        "Abstract": "This project is to investigate chip-scale high power high brightness laser sources based on coherent photonic crystal surface-emitting laser (PCSEL) arrays. While high power VCSEL arrays are commercially available, they are incoherently coupled and multimode, with low beam quality and low brightness. To achieve coherently coupled VCSEL arrays, very large number of VCSEL elements are needed due to the limitations in maximum achievable powers of few mW from aperture size limited single mode VCSELs. On the other hand, very large area single mode high brightness PCSELs have been demonstrated with powers of a few W to 10\u2019s and even 100\u2019s W. The power can be scaled up to kW levels with much less PCSEL elements, which simplifies the control\/feedback schemes for coherently coupled PCSELs. Additionally, by taking advantage of the intrinsic lateral coupling features in the PCSEL cavities, near-field based feedback and monitoring structures can be designed and incorporated for active coherency control. These unique features and innovative designs can lead to few element high power high brightness laser sources for on-chip DE applications with both high performance and improved SWaP. The proposed research is based on advances realized over the last 18 years by the team on defect-free photonic crystal cavities for free-space beam manipulation and light-matter interactions. A PCSEL modeling and simulation package was developed by Semergytech in 2021, as the first commercial package for PCSEL design and performance estimate. Over 1W output power was achieved recently at UTA. These results prepare us well to further advance the PCSEL array technology. The proposed structure has the following innovative features: (1) Much reduced array element sizes (2-3 orders less) due to intrinsically large aperture high power SM PCSELs; (2) On-chip near-field based feedback monitoring and control architecture, which offers fast and accurate phase control for the coherent PCSEL array operations; (3) All on-chip architecture for simplified optical design and thermal management with high reliability and low SWaP; (4) Potential beam shaping and beam steering capabilities with the control of the array element phases; and (5) Scalable architecture based on integrated photonics\/electronics, which enables high power high brightness laser sources at different power levels."

During the feasibility phase I effort, a robust coating repair system was developed and subsequently applied to railway steel. While the repair method worked on large gouges, it failed to bridge narrow cracks. In this work, both VRC and NU will investigate hybrid repair methods, such as, cold spray and secondary processing, cold spray and laser-glazing, wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) and cold spray for the specific purposes of repairing complex geometry and improving the performance of the repair. This phase II program will also investigate additional cold spray repair coating systems, to ensure the most robust repair method is deposited. Lastly, VRC will build and implement a mobile high-pressure cold spray unit and design a mobile trailer system for point-of-need repairs.

        "Abstract": "This work seeks to develop a receiver for high-power wireless energy transmission based on thermal-to-electric energy conversion using solid-state pyroelectric materials, which can convert time-varying temperature fluctuations to electricity, coupled with a modulated radiation source. The proposed receiver relies on a multilayer device architecture comprising nanometer-thick pyroelectric films that can achieve electric fields &gt;100\u00a0kV\u00a0cm-1 and enable thermal cycling at rates &gt;100\u00a0Hz leading to high power density. In order to maximize optical-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency and realize high-frequency thermal-electrical cycles, the receiver includes a front interface that maximizes absorption of free-space laser radiation into surface plasmon polaritons that strongly couple with optical phonons for efficient device heating, and a back interface comprising a graphene layer coupled with plasmonic structures that allows electric-field control of thermal emission. By combining electrothermal control of polarization in pyroelectric materials and control of emissivity in plasmonic structures, we will develop platforms to investigate the interaction of electro-optic, optothermal and electrothermal transport processes and enable next-generation power transmission, energy generation and sensing technologies."

We will address the manufacturability, electrical-to-optical and optical-to-optical efficiency, and a risk assessment of other parameters important to the energy transfer process. While side-pumping has been demonstrated for Ytterbium-doped fiber lasers, the diversity of ions used in fiber lasers (Yb, Nd, Yb-Er, Er, Tm, and Pr) requires a flexible and adaptable coupling process where the energy transfer can be tailored to the specific fiber construction, mode space, materials, and the specific dopant ion density.\u00a0"

        "Abstract": "A novel, single-cavity multi-wavelength source is proposed. The technology uses a highly optimized quantum dot gain medium that offers high efficiency, excellent stability with respect to reflections, high temperature operation, and flexibility to engineer the emission wavelength\/gain bandwidth. The material can be engineered to provide flat-top gain spectra across the entire O-band for optical communications and shorter wavelengths as desired. This material is then coupled with an innovative laser cavity architecture which can be engineered to emit arbitrarily chosen numbers of desired wavelengths and frequency spacings. The single-component nature of the device will enable improved reliability and system efficiency relative to incumbent technologies like arrays of single-wavelength lasers. These lasers are fabricated with industry-standard techniques available at scale, and layouts can be designed to provide arrays of these multiwavelength emitters. A low cost wafer scale package will be co-designed with the multi-wavelength laser to enable wafer-scale test and flexible outcoupling options to individual or arrayed fibers or to grating couplers on silicon photonic chips.\u00a0"

The required modifications include replacing the window on the DMD, changing the physical operating characteristics of the device, and changing the drive electronics and software.\u00a0 In addition to developing the modified DMD, our team has developed extensive simulation tools to model the operating characteristics of the device over a broad range of wavelengths and operating conditions.\u00a0 Our approach leverages existing, high volume, commercial components, through our partnership with Texas Instruments. The physical and electronic modifications of commercially available TI DMDs provide the unique potential for the device to operate over a broad spectrum of wavelengths, from 200 nm to 20 \u00b5m, and with operating speeds in excess of 20 kHz. Mustang Optics has previously demonstrated all of the Phase I metrics, 1024x768 format at a frame rate in excess of 20 kHz, for &gt; 3 patterns.\u00a0 In the THEBES Phase II program, we will demonstrate a hardware-in-the-loop test system with 4 Megapixels, a frame rate of at least 20 kHz, which will operate in the 3-5 \u00b5m waveband.\u00a0 In addition to the hardware-in-the-loop system, we will develop the sensitivity analysis tools which will allow us to generate patterns that test the limitations of the event sensors. The THEBES Phase II effort will demonstrate the key capabilities, performance metrics, and product maturity needed to transition to a Phase III Program. The THEBES Phase II effort will provide the foundation for this transition for both DoD requirements associated with new Event Sensors, as well as enabling capabilities for Hardware-in-the-Loop testing of many DoD visible and infrared sensors. In addition, the THEBES program will provide a foundation for military applications such as agile laser beam steering.\u00a0 Success of the THEBES Phase II SBIR program will provide Mustang Optics, and DARPA, with a proven prototype capability for testing event sensors, and will provide Mustang Optics with a transition of our Open Architecture approach to where we can address multiple additional DoD and commercial markets with a demonstrated, low risk capability.\u00a0 Completion of the THEBES program will transition the systems to a TRL of 6\/7, and an MRL of 5, allowing us to address near term markets such as 3D Printing, and IR Scene Projection with significantly lower transition risk, and less cost required to reach production.\u00a0\u00a0"

        "Abstract": "The fifth generation (5G) of mobile technologies will provide unprecedented improvements in connectivity, data speeds, latency, and bandwidth compared to existing 4G networks, enabling new military and commercial applications. In the military space, 5G will augment capabilities in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems by addressing their growing demand for increased bandwidth and speed for information processing and dissemination, it will enable new approaches to and capability in command and control, including latency reduction in satellite communications, increased efficiency in military logistic and maintenance and similar high data capacity applications. Phased-array antennas\u00a0are a major enabling technology to realize the potential of 5G and beyond. To address challenges in over-the-air (OTA) testing and measurement of\u00a0phased array antennas for 5G, Rydberg Technologies will develop a near-field probe and imager based on Rydberg atom electromagnetic field measurement and imaging technology that exploits Rydberg atom vapors sensitive to millimeter-wave (MMW) fields from 28GHz to 300GHz. \u00a0In this Phase II effort, Rydberg will prototype a broadband Rydberg-atom near-field probe and imager for high-resolution, speed, accuracy, and self-calibrated near-field measurements of MMW antennas for 5G and beyond. The Rydberg MMW imager will be comprised of a front-end with a vapor-cell imager probe and imaging system in a low-profile form factor for near-field measurements of antenna devices under test (DUTs). \u00a0The front-end imager probe is connected to a back-end unit housing a laser, optics, and electronics package for readout from the atomic vapor of spatial MMW fields in the near-field of DUTs. Two-dimensional near-field images of MMW amplitude, phase, and polarization are rendered for near-field to far-field transformations.\u00a0 In Phase II the Rydberg MMW imager will reach a technology readiness level 5 with a performance evaluation to target metrics for field amplitude, phase, and polarization accuracy, spatial resolution, and speed. Near-field imaging of 5G antennas will be demonstrated."

        "Abstract": "Real-time or in situ monitoring can reduce cost and build time for Laser Powderbed Fusion (LPBF) Additive Manufacturing processes, which is important for the Air Force as well as the industry. Estimates indicate savings can be as much as $150,000 per machine per year. However, current real-time monitoring solutions use very expensive sensors and\/or require a lot of calibration time to detect defects. The Air Force benefits from an accelerated integration of this technology across its service depots and labs. Moreover, the Air Force and its suppliers use different brands of machines, thus a brand agnostic solution is required. Addiguru\u2019s real-time monitoring solution for additive manufacturing is based on utilizing low-cost, off-the-shelf sensors that can be deployed quickly and inexpensively. In the Phase I STTR, Addiguru\u2019s current solution, using high-resolution optical cameras, was shown to be machine agnostic and rapidly deployable. Addiguru\u2019s solution is agnostic to not only machine brand, but also material, lighting, angle of camera, and type of camera. In this Phase II STTR effort, Addiguru, in teaming with The Ohio State University (OSU), will demonstrate the ability of Addiguru\u2019s solution to detect defects on a variety of different machine types which OSU possesses. Different materials, lighting, and camera angles will be used to prove the robustness of Addiguru\u2019s solution. Addiguru will also collect data on OSU\u2019s LPBF machines and train Addiguru\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) models to improve flaw detection. The link between anomaly and flaw characterization will be addressed, and a machine control decision-tree will be created to mitigate flaws in situ. The success of this STTR will lead to completion of TRL 7 and the solution will be ready for deployment at REACT\u2019s machines at Tinker AF base and Air Force Research Labs (AFRL)."

        "Abstract": "High-energy laser (HEL) architectures utilized in directed energy weapon (DEW) platforms rely upon high average power outputs and relatively slow (thermal) damage mechanisms, requiring 15+ second engagement times in practical situations. Engagements of this nature do not properly address the evolving set of asymmetric threats, specifically hypersonic and sUAS systems. This proposal presents a new paradigm of laser engagement,\u00a0leveraging rapid high intensity damage mechanisms\u00a0and\u00a0reducing system SWaP\u00a0without sacrificing average power deposition. Combining rapid material removal with current HEL engagement will lead to\u00a0order-of-magnitude reductions in threat engagement timescales. Solid-state lasers (SSLs) constitute a vital aspect of the DoD\u2019s directed energy engagement strategy, including the HELSI program aimed at HELs surpassing 500 kW in the near future. High-average, high-peak power outputs are directly attainable from such architectures. Development of the proposed system will be based on the transitional development of current commercial Burst-Mode Solid-State Lasers available at Spectral Energies, leading to practical, multi-platform realizations on the battlefield."

        "Abstract": "IFOS is working to rapidly transition to end users an innovative fiber-optic-based multi-functional temperature and pressure sensing capability to meet the need for novel instrumentation in propulsion systems (e.g., gas turbines) and industrial applications (e.g., smart factories). IFOS will use proven manufacturing technologies, including femtosecond laser micromachining and fiber-optic arc-fusion-splicing methods, to fabricate its Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) micro-sensors. The FPI sensors are remotely interrogated by a compact (smart-phone-sized) optoelectronic interrogator with signal transport and front-end processing at the speed of light with no speed bottlenecks or latencies. A key result of Phase I was the attainment of customer memoranda from AFRL\u2019s Turbine Engine Division (AFRL\/RQTE) at Wright-Patterson AFB and the Commodities Maintenance Group at Warner-Robins Air Logistics Complex. The proposed Phase II project will leverage the valuable learning from successful completion of Phase I project and demonstration of its feasibility. Phase II is expected to achieve TRL 6 through direct end-user involvement."

As a follow-on from Phase I efforts, this Phase II project proposes to optimize photoconductive\u00a0gallium nitride (GaN) devices, in a vertical geometry, \u00a0to meet the voltage and current requirements. Photoconductive GaN has demonstrated very high photoresponsivity with sub-gap excitation, allowing high current output with an inexpensive, compact, low-power, 405 nm laser diode. The scope of work includes optimizing GaN material doping and device geometry (substrate, thickness, area, contact geometry) with characterization of continuous and dynamic optical response, in addition to high-temperature behavior, culminating in the demonstration of a prototype small-form-factor optical switching device package. Material growth, device fabrication, and prototype design\/build will be completed by the lead, Kyma, and the majority of optical\u2013electrical testing, with supporting simulation efforts will be completed at UMKC (subcontractor)."

        "Abstract": "The United States Air Force (USAF) faces significant challenges in evaluating system performance of actively tracking radio frequency (RF) seeker systems subject to high energy laser (HEL) irradiation. Rapidly evolving technologies and the complexity and cost of testing can lead to gaps in knowledge regarding current system behaviors. Understanding the potential operational implications of both blue and red future systems is an even more complex challenge. There is little data available characterizing the impact of the use of HEL systems when employed to interfere with RF seeker systems. The USAF needs 1) a testing framework that can gather maximal data from minimal tests, 2) fast running, highly accurate, predictive models that can be trained on test data to predict the effects of HEL weapons on RF seeker systems, and 3) mission level models that can be combined with these predictive models to understand the impact of HEL systems in operational scenarios. OptTek Systems, Inc. (OptTek) is proposing a set of proven technologies that can be combined and applied to this problem along with an experienced team that has the background and expertise to achieve these goals. The team proposed to address this critical USAF need consists of OptTek, Infoscitex, Starwin Industries, and ARA.\u00a0 Working with USAF stakeholders, the OptTek team will leverage its previous experience with testing, RF systems, AI\/ML, modeling, and simulation to provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that links test data to a fast-running Kriging-based predictive proxy model to an AFSIM mission level simulation. The team will also provide a Phase 2 testing framework that adaptively select tests to execute that provide the data needed to maximize model prediction accuracy with minimal tests.\u00a0"

        "Abstract": "This project is to investigate a high-speed spatial light modulator (SLM) which is capable of amplitude and phase modulation at 1 GHz and above. The device can have a high laser induced damage threshold (LIDT) of 10 MW\/cm2 and above. The structure is based on advances in coupled photonic crystal cavities, crystalline semiconductor coating technologies, and an integrated photonic\/electronic scheme. Currently commercial SLM products are largely limited to modulation speeds in the kHz or low MHz regime. We will demonstrate a non-mechanical high-speed SLM combined with a read-out integrated circuit (ROIC) for individual pixel control, capable of switching speeds on the order of 1 GHz, which is multiple orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art. In collaborations with our industry partner, crystalline compound semiconductor thin films on transparent substrates will be incorporated for HEL DE applications with high LIDT and excellent thermal management capabilities. The proposed research is based on advances realized over the last 17 years by the team on defect-free photonic crystal cavities for free-space beam manipulation and light-matter interactions. The proposed approach has the following innovative features: (1) High speed: The structure can operate at GHz switching speeds, which will be 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than all other approaches based on liquid crystals or deformable mirrors; (2) High LIDT: The use of crystalline GaAs films can ensure excellent LIDT values of MW\/cm2 or higher; (3) Reliable: The structure is based on semiconductor and dielectric materials, which is all solid state without any moving parts; (4) Compact: The proposed structure can be built directly with conventional CMOS process employing similar integration schemes including ROICs combined via a hybridization process, similar to current commercial SLM devices; and (5) Scalable: The proposed architecture is based on the integrated photonic manufacturing process, which ensure its manufacturing scalability and device pixel scalability. \u00a0"

        "Abstract": "We will develop new cutting-edge concepts on photonic wavefront sensors technology to assess the beam quality of high energy lasers. This includes technologies related to directed energy for actively monitoring the optical beam quality of continuous wave and pulsed high power lasers at 1 micron wavelength operating at multi-kW average power levels. Our approach utilizes a unique photonic solution based on all-fiber photonic lanterns.\u00a0We will exploit this photonic component to develop an all-fiber wavefront sensor architecture for high-speed optical beam monitoring. The proposed approach will significantly reduce optical alignment risk, size, and weight compared to traditional bulk-optics wavefront sensing schemes. Photonic lanterns transform a complex optical beam pattern into multiple single mode fibers which can be interrogated to detect beam aberrations.\u00a0The use of these notions for wavefront sensing applications\u00a0represents a transformational technology for future high energy laser systems."

A software interface will be developed to create an AM process simulation software plug-in for two commercial LPBF systems. This interface will fetch the AM build plan track vectors generated by the LPBF system and return the FSP generated using AM process simulations from which the LPBF system will produce the build. The simulated time-temperature history for AM deposition, stress relief, and HIP will be used to predict grain size, microstructure, tensile properties, and fatigue life, which will be validated using mechanical testing data. The proposed work will deliver three high-quality structural parts and the software source code to create the AM process simulation plug-in to generate FSP for commercial LPBF systems. The three parts are T-38 aircraft dorsal cover rib for sustainment repair and two rotating detonation engines for hypersonic propulsion."

        "Abstract": "CLASP pushes the state of the art in the exploitation of Ultra-Short Pulse Lasers for the manufacturing of composite materials. Current methods of hand sanding, especially Sand-to-Black, have many challenges, including variable efficiency by operator and multiple steps to ensure preparation for bond are manually intensive and time consuming. A hand-positioned ultrafast laser ablation tool was prototyped and demonstrated by the University of Dayton Research Institute to address these challenges. Alber Aerospace, in partnership with UDRI, commercializes this prototype with design for manufacturing, engineering to ruggedize components to an industrial grade, and research to increase the operational throughput. A cost-effective upgrade of an existing prototype results in a first article for internal test and stakeholder evaluation. A concluding Product Readiness Review ensures all aspects of production, maintenance, and support are considered in the commercialization of this capability."

        "Abstract": "An emerging class of attritable aircraft are low-cost, un-manned assets that perform a defined, limited mission-set without having the durability or sustainment considerations typical of more highly capable aircraft platforms; however, many of the manufacturing processes used to create composite fuselage and other components rely on legacy techniques developed for more highly capable, and much more expensive aircraft. Creare\u2019s Hybrid Composite Material (HCM) for attritable aircraft component production will meet the demanding requirements of the USAF, while leveraging novel, mature manufacturing processes to significantly reduce component cost and production time. We are teaming with key partners to make use of existing tools and to leverage several advanced manufacturing technologies to fabricate the HCM, including: 3D printing, fiber placement, and laser-based heating processes. These technologies are either commercially-available or transition-ready, dramatically shortening the time to a fielded solution. During the Phase I project, we will work with partners, end-users and customers to specify key requirements, develop initial technology integration plans, and analytically demonstrate the viability of our approach. During Phase II, we will demonstrate HCM manufacturing, establish material qualification requirements, and complete manufacturing and production planning."

        "Abstract": "We set out in the Phase I program to design a handheld, non-contact laser ultrasound (ncLUS) imager for aiding combat medics\u2019 fast triaging on injured Warfighters in the battlefield. The ncLUS imager is to enable rapid assessments on conditions of internal hemorrhage and presence of foreign objects like shrapnel fragments through ultrasound imaging, all in non-contact manner and with the desired device form factor similar to recent generation of smart phones. By leveraging the device principles of (1) optical excitation of ultrasound waves in human tissues, (2) optical detection of back-scattered ultrasound waves on human skin surface and, (3) skin pigment and skin surface condition independent photodetection, several iterations of ncLUS imager designs were developed in the Phase I program, with successively reduced device dimensions and added functionalities. As of the end of the Phase I program (March 2022), the latest ncLUS imager design supports the dimensions of 77 mm x 190 mm x 35 mm. It also supports a wide range of operational capabilities ranging from eye-safe operation, auto-scanning, supports variable standoff distance between the ncLUS imager and the injured Warfighter\u2019s body surface, near-infrared (NIR) camera for targeting the evaluation area as well as standoff distance measurement, body surface contour\/topography compensation and image correction, as well as a large liquid crystal display (LCD) for aiming the ncLUS and displaying the reconstructed ultrasound images. Design details on the various laser sources, optics, and the associated optomechanical mounts have been identified. Also included in the Phase I activity involve the detailed design work on various electronics that maintains the proper function of the ncLUS imager, electrical power supply and management, wi-fi communication with external devices. When combined with the ultrasound image reconstruction algorithms developed in the Phase I program, the electronic circuit boards are also developed to support reconstruction and presentation of the ultrasound images on the LCD display of the ncLUS imager. A number of pathways to further device miniaturization will be considered in the Phase II program and they include (1) custom-build of miniaturized laser sources, (2) use of \u00bd\u201d optics in the ncLUS imager and, (3) deployment of micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) mirror scanner and photo-detector array. The resultant ncLUS imager device thickness has been preliminarily determined to be 28 mm and 17 mm, respectively, for the \u00bd\u201d-optics option and the MEMS scanner approach. Prototype ncLUS imager will be built and delivered to the Government. Lab based tests using grocery meats and demonstration on human subjects will be pursued after relevant IRB clearance. Two visits are also proposed to the Army Medic School for demonstrating the ncLUS imager to combat medics. \u00a0"

        "Abstract": "Monolithic integration of lasers by direct growth on Si has generated much interest as a means to take advantage of the rapidly expanding capabilities of photonic integrated circuit manufacturing offered by large-area, full wafer (silicon IC manufacturing is up to 18\u201d-diameter wafers at present) Si. Since large area InP substrates are prohibitively expensive (6\u201d InP wafers cost about $3K), the use of large area Si substrates (upto 12\u201d wafers) offers a pathway to significantly lower the manufacturing costs of QCLs.\u00a0 The direct integration of optical sources, such as quantum cascade lasers and detectors with Si-based photonics (waveguides, modulators, diffraction gratings, etc.) could also enable compact integrated lab-on-chip chemical sensing systems. In this Phase I MicroLink devices extensive experience in growth of metamorphic buffer layer for lattice constant grading will be combined with the QCL growth expertise developed at University of Wisconsin-Madison group of Prof. Luke Mawst and Prof. Dan Botez, to develop metamorphic buffer layers to reach InP lattice constant on Silicon substrates. \u00a0The focus of Phase-I is to demonstrate that sufficiently low dislocation density buffer layers with low surface roughness can be grown on Si substrates.\u00a0 During the Phase-I base period, we will investigate the use of specially designed compositionally graded buffer layers dislocation filtering buffer layers combined with commercially available Ge on Si substrates. SL structures will be grown on such buffer layers to assess the effectiveness for the subsequent QCL growth during a Phase-I option period"

These are summarized below: High efficiency: maximizes the efficiency of the laser system using a direct diode approach. High Brightness: Using WBC and diodes the same beam quality of the laser system is achieved as that of a single emitter minimizing the M2 of the system, necessary for long distance atmospheric propagation. Scalable and Modular: The wavelength beam combination technique provides the most scalable approach to beam combination, there is no limit to the number of emitters that can be included in a WBC system. Compactness: Without any active elements and high power density, a WBC direct diode system offers low specific weight density (kg\/kW). Wavelength Selectability: WBC can be employed at any wavelength semiconductor lasers are available, increasing scalability, and atmospheric transmission. Low subsystem size: The high efficiency of WBC allows for reduced need for cooling and electrical power."

        "Abstract": "The objectives of the proposed Phase II program are to design, fabricate, test, and deliver a 5 kW CW, S-Band magnetron capable of fast tuning across =5 MHz with a data transmission rate of 2 Mb\/sec using simple frequency shift keying, and with minimum size, power and weight. Frequency and phase control of the magnetron will be accomplished using an array of varactors controlled by feedback loop circuitry.\u00a0 Development will be done at a frequency of 2450 MHz to utilize existing microwave hardware, but the results will be applicable to magnetrons over a wide range of frequency and power. The phase-locked magnetron will not require a circulator or high-power driver. Instead, the magnetron will be locked by a feedback circuit providing high loop bandwidth and low phase noise.\u00a0 The system will electronically tune the magnetron cavities with a varactor array driven by a closed-loop, feedback circuit.\u00a0 The magnetron will thusly be\u00a0converted into a voltage-controlled oscillator locked to an RF reference source. When fully packaged, the circuitry will add less than 10% to the system size and weight. The result will be an efficient, low-cost system with low size, weight, and power, (SWaP). Because the purpose of this program is to demonstrate the basic technology, the specific frequency was chosen to be 2450 MHz.\u00a0 This allows use of relatively inexpensive and readily available components. The prototype RF source will be a modified, commercial magnetron. This will be faster and less expensive than developing a new tube. The technology will scale with minimal effort to other frequencies in S-Band, and for that matter, other frequencies for which magnetrons are available.\u00a0 The control circuitry is derived from a phase-locked laser system developed by SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC), the research partner on the program. The proposed program is in three one-year phases: Base, Option 1 and Option 2.\u00a0 In the base program, the magnetron with the port for the varactor array will be fabricated and tested without the varactors. A varactor array will be fabricated and used, with a simple biasing scheme without feedback, to test the ability to tune the magnetron.\u00a0 These tasks (1-3) will be performed primarily by Calabazas Creek Research, Inc. (CCR) and Communications &amp; Power Industries, Inc. (CPI), the industrial partner on the program. The control circuit will be developed in parallel at SLAC.\u00a0 SLAC will build a benchtop control circuit, write firmware and software, and test the system.\u00a0 (Tasks 4 \u2013 7).\u00a0 In Option 1, the control system will be tested with the magnetron: first with it unpowered (Task 8), then at full power (Tasks 9-11).\u00a0 A fully packaged system will be designed in Task 12.\u00a0 In Option 2, the packaged system will be fabricated, tested, and delivered to the Navy for evaluation."

        "Abstract": "Despite their widespread adoption, one of the main hurdles holding QCLs back from large volume manufacturing is the large cost of ownership. While QCLs, like most semiconductor devices based on III-V compounds, can leverage the economies of scale typical of semiconductor manufacturing, and therefore lower production cost at wafer and chip level, it is at the testing and packaging stages of QCL production that most of the cost can build up and not scale as easily in large volumes. One of the most time-consuming steps during the post-fabrication testing and packaging process is device burn-in. Burn-in generally consists in running the devices in controlled conditions deemed representative of the actual operating specs in the field for a number of hours. This is done in order to screen out possible early degradation issues that may lead to costly device replacement after system installation is complete. Notwithstanding the importance of this issue, up till now there are no recognized industry standards for device burn-in qualification procedures and there are no proven models for laser degradation to support such procedures. Optimizing early screening of defective devices by improved burn-in procedures is likely going to reduce post-fabrication costs (testing, packaging, installation, etc.) which in large volume manufacturing typically represent the largest portion of production costs. A long burn-in procedure (i.e. 100hrs or more) can help reduce the rate of rejection of QCLs from ~20% straight out of the wafer to less than 2% when delivered to the customer, so a 10-fold reduction in returned product costs both for the manufacturer and for the final user. This result though, comes at the cost of a very time-consuming procedure that cannot easily be scaled up to large volumes without increasing the cost of capital equipment and production logistics. Reducing the burn-in time to a few hours, or maybe even minutes, at least for the devices most likely to fail, will unlock a great cost reduction for the manufacturer that can be passed on to the final user. Instead of a top-down approach where the device behavior is explained by a priori assumptions about the degradation mechanisms and origin of defects, in this project we took a bottom-up approach where we trained machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify device characteristics based on the BI degradation results observed and built a predictive tool for future device behavior that can identify faulty devices from the very first measurements. This can drastically reduce the need for a long, time consuming burn-in to screen out defective devices. A significant reduction of testing cost and replacement cost by correct identification of defective devices at the early stages of their characterization will lead to significant savings for the customer in terms of both acquisition and maintenance costs. In Phase I we have shown that our predictive tool allows us to do just that."

        "Abstract": "To address the Strategic Capabilities Office\u2019s need for a high-throughput photonic processor for artificial intelligence\/machine learning programs, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (Intellisense) proposes to develop a new Ultrafast Robust Optical Correlator (UROC) based on Intellisense\u2019s previously demonstrated Real-time Holographic Optical Correlator (RHOC) approach. The UROC system will build upon the demonstrated RHOC approach with a new high-throughput phase-only spatial light modulator (POSLM) design based on a state-of-the-art digital micromirror device (DMD) with temporal multiplexing using high-speed laser diode (LD) switching. The innovation in the use of a DMD-based POSLM design allows improvement in the correlator performance in terms of throughput with potentiality of =100k frames per second (fps) at =8k imagery resolution. Using the latest photonic technologies (LD, CMOS\/CCD sensors, FPGA electronics), UROC will be miniature in size, light weight, consume low power, and generate low heat. The digital nature of the DMD also allows on-chip binarization of input images without the need for prefiltering and provides a one-step interference process. In this direct-to-Phase II, Intellisense will improve upon the demonstrated RHOC architecture with a new DMD-based POSLM to design, develop the UROC prototype, demonstrate performance of &gt;2.5k fps and imagery with resolution &gt;2k pixels (&gt;20\u00d7 the 1990 capability), provide all required deliverables, produce studies addressing =100k fps throughput and =8k imagery resolution, and address counter-adversarial issues."

        "Abstract": "Bascom Hunter proposes a Photonic AI Processor (PHASOR) to deliver automatic target recognition (ATR) at a rate of 75,000 frames per second (FPS) using 4k resolution images. PHASOR will deliver these results in a 1U form factor using a combination of Neuromorphic Processors in the form of FPGAs and Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs). In previous work, Bascom Hunter, partnering with Princeton University, demonstrated the performance of Matrix Vectro Multiplication (MVM) using PICs. We were able to implement 2x10 photonic arrays. The microring resonator (MRR)-based design was able to achieve a matrix loading speed of 2 Gbps, an input vector loading speed of 24 Gbps and an energy consumption per multiply and accumulate (MAC) operation of 1 pJ\/bit. With a 2x2 matrix, we have shown computational performance of 0.16 Terra Operations Per Second (TOPS) and a latency of 200 ps. The latency of 200 ps can be compared to Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) latency of 10 ms. In Phase II, we will be laying the groundwork for the PHASOR product. We will be utilizing the previously designed 2x10 photonic MVM to create a CNN for MNIST classification. Our proposed design can implement a 4x4 MVM kernel (utilizing two 2x10 PICs) with a modulated laser input at 10 GSps (Vector update speed) and an MRR update at 1 GSps (Matrix update speed). We expect the 4x4 kernel in Phase II to provide 150k FPS for the MNIST dataset when using a stride of 1."

        "Abstract": "The achievable network topologies and performance of the SDA Transport Layer will depend on the ability to deploy low SWaP, high-performance, and flexible laser communication terminals (LCTs). Beamsteering is one of the critical limiting technologies for LCTs that can deliver the necessary performance. Currently available beamsteering components drive a significant fraction of LCT SWaP, force challenging platform and network architecture tradeoffs, and simply cannot support the kind of advanced network topologies best suited for the operational demand. This proposal offers to complete a rapid and cost-effective high-fidelity demonstration of an emerging beamsteering technology, the Lightfield Directing Array (LDA), that has the potential to overcome current limitations and enable leap-ahead performance in terms of SWaP, dynamic performance, and dense multi-node networking. Together with partner General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems (GA-EMS), this 18-month project will complete a high-fidelity LDA enabled LCT (LDA-LCT) HWIL testbed configuration, demonstrating newly enabled CONOPS and experimentally validating operational performance.\u00a0 Upon completion of the base effort, the technology and infrastructure is in place to proceed immediately to prototype flight demonstration and rapid operational deployment."

        "Abstract": "The innovation of this proposal, \u201cCarbon Fiber\/Polysiloxane (C\/UHTR) Prepreg Tape for Automatic Tape Placement (ATP),\u201d utilizes Techneglas\u2019 Ultra High Temperature Resin (UHTR) as the basis to develop an easily transportable, conveniently storable, and ready-to-use prepreg tape. This novel technology can be utilized to additively manufacture complexly shaped Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) using Out of Autoclave (OoA) methods, resulting in parts suitable for use in hypersonic flight systems. Building a new ablative system from the ground up can take upwards of a decade, requiring substantial funding and resources. One of KAI\u2019s strengths is its ability to use system integration to unify the best aspects of existing technology into a novel and superior technology. KAI proposes the integration of two well-matured systems: Techneglas\u2019 polysiloxane resin and ATP additive manufacturing. C\/UHTR molding compound has been proven to be superior to commercially available legacy carbon\/phenolic molding compound (C\/Ph, MX-4926N MC) ablative system during laboratory testing, and UHTR has demonstrated excellent properties as additive manufacturing stock material for selective laser sintering. C\/UHTR can also be post-processed into a radio transparent ceramic matrix composite if desired. C\/UHTR composite systems would move from TRL 4 to 5 by the end of this SBIR program. For Phase I, KAI will screen carbon fibers to ensure compatibility with the UHTR system and ATP processes. Nanomaterial and filler loading studies will be conducted to tailor C\/UHTR prepreg tape for ease of transport, storage, and manufacturing. Final formulations will be used to create test billets for testing in order to ensure that TPS properties are retained and similar to other C\/UHTR systems developed by KAI. For Phase II, KAI will validate its top-performing formulations at the NASA Ames Arc Jet Complex or NASA Langley HYMETs arc jet and use the data to validate a predictive material response ablation model. Throughout this proposal, KAI will continue to advance its collaboration with interested government agencies and related contractors, such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Northrup Grumman."

        "Abstract": "The proposal develops a comprehensive additive manufacturing (AM) metal-powder Grain-Boundary-Engineering (GBE) toolset to improve material mechanical, fracture, and fatigue properties. Phase I developed an Integrated Computational Material engineering (ICME) physics-based tool set to implement GBE modelling to improve microstructure of an AM polycrystalline material and to optimize the microstructure from Equiaxed to coincidence-site-lattice (CSL) grain boundaries, low-angle-grain-boundaries (LAGB) grains, with\/without nano-inclusions. Phase I demonstrated and test validated the feasibility of AM build of polycrystalline stainless-steel with improved strength and strain. Phase II will further improve ICME software to reduce \u201cTrial-Error\u201d in AM process, reduce cycle time for part qualification, and accelerate materials development by establishing AM \u201cDigital Twin\u201d. AM creates several complex thermal processes which alter mechanical properties in terms of strength and plasticity, as the result of a material\u2019s microstructure changes. GBE by multi-scale modelling will be performed to expedite qualification process for existing and new AM polycrystalline alloys. Phase II will expand the Phase I findings from steel to a high temperature polycrystalline super alloy that exhibits crack and weldability issues. Successful ICME based Optimized CSL\/LAGB during AM by thermal-heating, fast-cooling, melt-excitation, and inclusion techniques will entail: (i) Micro-thermal-management to determine the thermal-history (melt-pool depth\/width, superheated-cooling), Material state (voids\/density), %crystallization, process-map of stable and unstable print regions, (ii) Nano-Micro-mechanical analytical modeling, predicting mechanical properties (stresses-strain), layers distortion\/curvature, considering inclusion, defects and uncertainties. (iii) grain-boundary-modeling (GBM) using creep-diffusion algorithms, predicting surface-roughness, residual stress\/strain, cracks (inter-granular\/trans-granular), oxidation, (iv) visualization of 3D Voxel Electron-back-scatter-diffraction (EBSD) image, and (v) progressive-failure-analysis of improved mechanical properties (failure-strain, yield\/ultimate strength). ICME based Design of Experiment (DOE) Framework Optimization will be used to determine AM machine parameters, alloy composition, temperature-precipitates (TTP) formation for improved ductility, strength, toughness, fatigue, and weldability. A building block prediction validation strategy will be implemented on AM design, build, and test of: a) Non critical Stainless steel bracket using EOS\/Concept-laser LPBF AM Machines, and b) critical Inconel 738 turbine blade using ARCAM EBM AM machine. ICME driven design will be compared\/validated with tests including: a) printing specimens using machine equipped in-Situ-monitored sensors, and NDE measurement, failure-strains, and b) use of SEM\/TEM microscopy, Electron-beam-scatter-diffraction (EBSD) imaging."

The proposed research and development project will investigate the production of optical-grade SiC material utilizing novel approach sintering ceramic technology which offers potential cost saving break throughs while maintaining the desired optical and technical performance.

        "Abstract": "Cornerstone Research Group (CRG) will demonstrate application of an existing in-house design tool for generation of cellular lightweight and jitter mitigating support structures and mechanisms for a high energy laser directed energy beam control system. By performing topology optimization of additively manufactured conformal lattice structures, the overall mass can be significantly reduced while also driving the design to geometries exhibiting vibration damping by taking advantage of unique design methodologies. During Phase I, CRG added a new vibration mitigation objective to the design methodology specifically well suited for beam control design based on identified requirements and experimentally evaluated an applicable geometry using the in-house design tool showing favorable vibration characteristics and successful mass reduction. Phase II will expand the design activities to a full beam control system by applying the design methodology to selected sub-components with operationally relevant testing while also refining the capabilities of the design methodology and associated design tool.

        "Abstract": "For many important military tasks, such as the defense of surface ships against saturation attacks by swarms of drones or cruise missiles, expendable munitions are ineffective because they can be easily and cheaply overwhelmed, and the only realistic solution is provided by electrically powered laser weapons which offer a \u201cdeep magazine\u201d and the ability to rapidly engage a multiplicity of widely divergent targets. Existing directed energy lasers are based on fiber-laser technology, which has many attractive characteristics but suffers from poor electrical-to-optical conversion efficiency because the conversion involves two cascaded steps: conversion of electricity to pump photons, and subsequent conversion of pump photons to the laser photon. Each of these steps involves loss of power and generation of waste heat. This has serious system implications in that much larger power sources and waste heat radiators are required than would theoretically be necessary. Diode lasers which convert electricity directly to the final output beam can cut the waste heat load by more than a factor of two compared to fiber lasers, but standard diode lasers have beam optical qualities that are too poor to be used directly in weapons, and both their spectral and beam qualities are incompatible with the beam combining technologies that are needed to obtain militarily required output powers. We are developing high power diode lasers based on monolithic master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) designs that generate narrow line single-frequency beams with diffraction-limited beam and powers in the tens of Watts. These performance levels are orders of magnitude better than conventional diode designs. These diode designs are compatible with both coherent and incoherent beam combining technologies, and are highly manufacturable at low cost using conventional fabrication technologies.

        "Abstract": "MDA is interested in developing single mode high power diode lasers with excellent beam quality and high efficiency and coherently combine them for high power output and use the coherently combined modules to build high power direct diode laser (HPDDL) systems capable of achieving upwards of 10-100 kW (dependent on the beam combining technique) of high output power while maintaining the beam quality to a near diffraction limited spot size (M2&lt; 1.2) in a low size, weight, and power (SWaP) configuration. We propose an approach for single mode VCSELs and for coherently combining them for very high power with the eventual goal of application in the HPDDL systems. Diode laser based high power systems will be small, high efficiency (close to 70%) and much lower cost compared to current fiber laser based approaches. Princeton Innotech offers an approach for high power single mode diode lasers and coherently coupling them for multi-kW single modules. We have successfully demonstrated a coupling approach through simulation and experiments which we will use in phase II to demonstrate a coherently coupled high power VCSEL array. We plan to further develop the high power coherently coupled modules and commercialize them in phase III. Approved for Public Release | 22-MDA-11102 (22 Mar 22)"

        "Abstract": "An explicit computational framework for mechanical surface treatments; such as laser shock peening (LSP), low plasticity burnishing (LPB), and shot peening (SP) is highly sought by designers of critical commercial and defense aerospace parts in the ability to accurately capture relevant residual stress (RS) and damage states for optimal fatigue resistant. \u00a0In particular, the shockwave induced by LSP can produce residual stresses deeper into the material than other surface treatment processes, while also minimizing the deformation of the surface. However, under certain loading and geometry conditions the shockwave is prone to inducing subsurface cracking (i.e., spall fracture). A better understanding for the LSP process of the RS field through visualization of the shock-wave behavior and the resulting data in the material to critical process parameters, material properties, and geometry effects are all of interest. Corvid and Curtiss-Wright Surface Technologies proposes to explicitly capture the LSP process with an experimentally validated high-fidelity computational physics (HFCP) numerical framework following the laser shock peening process of complex geometries. Within the Phase I effort, Corvid demonstrated success in developing an HFCP framework for predicting outcomes of interest in LSP within 80% confidence for planar material coupons of Ti-6Al-4V as a function of varying LSP processing effects (irradiance, pulse width, overlap, peening patterns). In the Phase II, Corvid proposes to i) advance the physics based modeling approach to account for complex geometry (i.e. turbine blades\/bulkheads), ii) investigate and define the damage limits needed for the LSP process, and iii) complete the feedback loop from the modeling approach to component design in order to optimize service life. The scale up of from material coupons with predominately planar features to more representative complex parts accounting for a component\u2019s fillets, thin sections, and leading edges will be explicitly modeled and experimentally validated. Validation of the LSP process will be achieved by advancing from a one-dimensional RS characterization to multi-dimensional RS characterization and damage investigation through the inclusion of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and fatigue cycling. Finally, these computationally intensive high-fidelity multi-physics LSP simulations for a range of geometries, laser processing variables, and material sensitives will be used as training data for transitioning to reduced order models (ROM) to further inform crack growth assessments and increase confidence in component lifetime predictions as well as capture any inadvertent damage created through the LSP process."

        "Abstract": "We have recently shown that photo-activation of riboflavin and mechanical stiffening of the\ncornea can be achieved using 760 nm infrared Femtosecond laser light through a two photon,\nnonlinear optical (NLO) process. The primary advantage of NLO over the existing\ntechnology is that cross linking occurs only within the two-photon focal volume of the FS\nlaser light, providing precise control over the area, depth and geometry of the\nmechanically stiffened cornea that can be easily tailored to the patient&apos;s corneal\ntopography. We have further patented an FS laser delivery system and shown that can vary\nthe two-photon focal volume by changing the numerical aperture (NA) of the focusing lens to\ngreatly expand the lateral and axial dimensions of the CXL region up to 150 \u03bcm of the corneal\nthickness. This greatly speeds up the NLO process, providing a more rapid procedure\ncompared to that of standard treatments. We have also established that using regeneratively\namplified FS laser pulses, mechanical stiffening of rabbit corneas can be achieved with an\noverall power of lt46.1 mW, below the ANSI thermal limits for laser exposure to the eye.\nAdditionally, we have shown in a live rabbit model that our NLO CXL device can crosslink a 4\nmm diameter central corneal region in 5 minutes and produce 1-2 diopters of corneal flattening.\nWe have further developed an FS corneal epithelial micromachining method to enhance\npenetration of chemicals through the epithelium without producing epithelial damage before or\nafter the procedure, thus avoiding the major adverse effects of standard protocols. With this\nnovel technology now in hand, we are ready to develop a clinical prototype that will allow for the\ntesting of this device to treat keratoconus and low degrees of myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia\nand astigmatism."

An emerging HOS analysis\ntechnique is hydroxyl radical foot-printing (HRPF). HRPF involves the irreversible\nlabeling of a protein\u2019s exterior by reaction with hydroxyl radicals with subsequent MS\nanalysis to identify the outer portions of the protein. The most widely used method for\ngenerating OH radicals employs a quick burst of UV light, and is appropriately called fast\nphotochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP).We have developed commercial solutions to\nperform in vitro FPOP. The practice of applying the results of in vitro structural\nexperiments to authentic in vivo behavior has been brought into question.\nMacromolecular crowding within a cell limits diffusion, thus altering reaction kinetics,\nassociation rates of proteins, and protein-DNA interactions. These effects are not\nobserved while performing in vitro studies. Because of in vitro shortcomings, there has\nbeen recent desire to extend the use of FPOP to whole cells in an in vivo manner.The practice of in vivo or in-cell FPOP (IC-FPOP) has been pioneered by Dr. Lisa\nJones of the University of Maryland. While showing great promise to address unmet\nchallenges in pharmaceutical research, reproducibility for IC-FPOP is challenged by\nvariability of intracellular background scavenging, cell-to-cell isolation irreproducibility,\nand the mandatory use of hazardous, complicated, and poorly reproducible excimer\nlasers. Collaborating with the Jones laboratory, our work will extend our innovative in\nvitro laser-free FPOP technology to in vivo applications. GenNext Technologies is the\nonly company commercializing products for FPOP HOS analysis. Our goal is to convert\nthe IC-FPOP process from an academic research experiment into a valuable analytical\ntool. Once simplified and transformed into a robust technique, we envision IC-FPOP to\nenable cell-based assays to: paratope and epitope the interaction of mAb\nbiopharmaceuticals with their membrane targets; elucidate the dynamics of lead binding\nto orthosteric or allosteric membrane targets; to reveal secondary messenger signaling\ncascades of GPCR lead compounds; and to detect the impact of anti-neoplastics upon\ntargets such as kinases and growth factors."

        "Abstract": "Single molecule DNA\/RNA transport and Raman sequencing technology based on parallel Ramanscattering readout in a coupled nanochannel\/nanopore system.\nAbstract\nArmonica Technologies, Inc. is proposing to develop a novel, high-throughput, label-free, highly\naccurate, long-read DNA sequencing platform based on inexpensive nanoscale patterning and self-\nassembly. The platform consists of nanochannels (cross section dimensions of ~ 100nm); tortuous\n(convoluted 3D) nanopores formed by self-assembly of colloidal nanoparticles; nanoparticle barriers\nplaced across the nanochannels; and a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) field enhancement structure atop the\nnanochannel roof. In operation, single- stranded- or double-stranded-DNA is partially stretched into a\nlinear configuration in the nanochannels, is blocked at barriers incorporated into the channels and forced\n(by electric field) to translocate through the tortuous nanopores in the roof. The MIM structure on the roof\nlocally enhances the electromagnetic fields of applied laser sources allowing surface enhanced coherent\nanti-Stokes Raman scattering (SECARS) detection of individual bases as they pass through the\nelectromagnetic hot spots, thus providing single base sensitivity and spatial localization. The distinct\nRaman spectra of the individual bases and epigenetic variants allow label-free sequencing. Optical\ndetection allows massively parallel operation since the only requirement is separation of the pores by\nmore than an optical wavelength, easily accomplished in the fabrication. An important feature of the\nplatform is that the porous roofs allow introduction of oligonucleotides, small proteins, and DNA-\nbinding\/DNA-processing enzymes, permitting optional manipulation and modification of the DNA in the\nnanochannels. The goals of this Phase II project are: to develop a protocol for electrophoretic control of\nthe ssDNA translocation; to engineer the structure to ensurethat the ssDNA passes the MIM hot spot; to\nsequence a short section of ssDNA and evaluate error rates; and to develop parallel optical readout, AI\nanalysis of the data and appropriate storage protocol."

        "Abstract": "This proposal aims to enable a new generation of high-speed, low-cost, wavelength-flexible swept source\noptical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) imaging device technology targeting applications in dental imaging and\nbased on microelectromechanical systems vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (MEMS-VCSELs) and planar\nlightwave circuits (PLCs). MEMS-VCSELs provide an unmatched combination of high and variable axial scan\nrate, dynamic single mode operation enabling long imaging range, and the potential for low-cost volume\nmanufacturing through wafer scale fabrication and testing. The proposed effort involves a collaboration between\nPraevium Research, which pioneered MEMS-VCSELs for SS-OCT, and the University of Washington (UW), a\nworld leader in SS-OCT structural and angiographic imaging in dentistry. This work seeks both to advance dental\nimaging science through new imaging tools and promote commercialization in cost-sensitive dental markets.Praevium Research will develop new high axial scan rate MEMS-VCSEL swept sources near water\nabsorption minima at 1700nm and 2200nm, to enable longer imaging range due to reduced scattering at longer\nwavelengths. Imaging at these wavelengths may be particularly important in improving the ability of OCT to\nnoninvasively determine periodontal pocket depth. In addition, Praevium will combine emerging electrically\npumped MEMS-eVCSELs at 1310nm with advanced PLC technology, replacing bulky and environmentally\nsensitive fiber networks commonly employed in SS-OCT by lithographically defined waveguide devices. This\nwill allow a radically miniaturized low-cost and stable SS-OCT subsystem with MEMS-VCSEL, optical amplifier,\nwavelength monitoring, and MZI interferometers on a single chip in a compact butterfly package, overcoming\nlong-standing cost barriers to SS-OCT in dentistry.UW collaborators will use various generations of high axial scan rate MEMS-VCSELs, starting at 1310nm\nand migrating to 1700nm and 2200nm as these latter sources are developed, to develop real-time wide field of\nview (FOV) whole mouth structural (OCT) and label-free angiographic (OCTA) periodontal imaging. Current\nmethods for assessing periodontal disease rely on invasive probing, induce unnecessary pain and bleeding, and\nare error-prone due to inconsistent frequency and force of probing and due to the complexity of gingival thickness\nand appearance. The proposed SS-OCT technology, by contrast, has the potential to create qualitative and\nquantitative imaging of microstructure and vasculature in gingival tissue. This will enable a comprehensive\nperiodontal imaging diagnostic suite which can assess periodontal attachment, alveolar bone quality and level,\ngingival inflammation, sub gingival calculus plaque and tissue biotype. Such a system can also provide an\nobjective means to determine and evaluate the prognosis of periodontal, regenerative and restorative therapies,\nimprove computer-aided design and machining (CAD\/CAM) for dental restorative procedures and planning, and\nbecome a reliable tool for long term monitoring and maintenance in clinical practice for oral health."

        "Abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY \/ ABSTRACT\nPolychromatic flow cytometry (FC) is a vital analytical technique used in immunology, basic\nresearch, and clinical medicine. FC is an indispensable tool for understanding disease\ndevelopment at the cellular and subcellular levels and for monitoring the effectiveness of new\nimmunotherapies by identifying key cellular subpopulations using multiple biomarkers within a\npanel. It also has a critical role in growing clinical applications including development of\nvaccines for infectious diseases, characterization of immunological cells and responses related\nto transplantation and treatment of graft-versus-host disease, and development of vaccines and\nimmune therapies to prevent and treat HIV infections. Increasing the number of spectrally\ndistinct fluorophores will give researchers greater flexibility and give clinicians a higher level of\naccuracy in the diagnosis and management of conditions where the size of the sample used for\ndiagnosis is limited or cell number is low, including those derived from fine needle aspiration,\nlaparoscopy, core biopsy, and cerebrospinal fluid. Improvements in optics and lasers have\ndriven the recent introduction of new fluorophores for FC. However, most of these possess\nbroad and often overlapping emission profiles, much like traditional fluorophores. Overlapping\nspectra can be resolved by the combined use of bandpass filters and mathematical\ncompensation (overlap subtraction); however, such compensation increases experiment error,\nreduces sensitivity, and limits multiplexing. Thus, even with a prototype 64-color instrument,\nleading investigators have only been able to implement a 40-parameter panel \u2013 advances in\nreader technology have outstripped available capabilities in fluorophores.\nNIRvana Sciences is developing two families of tetrapyrrole fluorophores for use in FC. These\nfluorophores are excellent candidates for use in polychromatic FC due to their ultra-violet\/violet\nexcitation, long Stoke\u2019s shifts into the red and near-infrared spectrums, and very narrow\nemissions. In the current project, NIRvana seeks to complete development of a new technology,\nreferred to as FluoroPods, that allows us to fully utilize our unique portfolio of dyes. This\npolymer-based system enables the use of dyes that possess excellent spectral properties but\nlack sufficient water solubility and\/or are heavily quenched in biological systems. Upon\ncompletion of the project, NIRvana Sciences will have created a palette of exceptionally bright\nFluoroPods that will form the basis of a platform of 22+ new colors using only the 355 and 405\nnm lasers."

        "Abstract": "Portable Optical Imager for Multiplexed Foodborne Pathogen Detection\nProject Summary\nFood contamination caused by pathogens is a significant public health concern for consumers worldwide.\nCritical aspects of limiting foodborne disease outbreaks and epidemic involve early detection and rapid\ndiagnostics of foodborne pathogens which require sensitive, multiplexed devices that enable point-of-care\n(POC) diagnostics. New generations of rapid (detection in minutes to hours), portable, multiplexed and\nsensitive biosensors can significantly aid in delivery of a safer food supply.\nNanohmics proposes to develop a low-cost portable optical imager that is capable of fast (lt 30\nminutes), sensitive (tens to hundreds of bacteria or viruses), and multiplexed testing of up to tens of\nfoodborne pathogens from fresh produce swab fluids or rinsates and comparable food surface\nsamples. Specifically, the proposed research will integrate low-cost large-area pixelated nanohole\narray (NHA) biosensing chips and economical optical and electronical components in to a compact,\nhighly portable, battery-operated and rugged biosensor device. While NHA plasmonic biosensors\nalready exist as bench-level laboratory experimental set ups, the technology has not been innovated to make\nit portable and multiplexed for field use to test numerous imported or domestic foods onsite where the FDA\nand USDA are overwhelmed with samples. Compared to conventional reflection-type plasmonic biosensors\nemploying a prism, NHAs support collinear excitation and collection configuration. This not only\nsignificantly simplifies alignment and but also enables small footprint and highly multiplexed biosensing.\nNanohmics will microspot NHA-based pixel arrays with different bioreceptors where the type of target is\nencoded in the position of the corresponding spot pixels. The team will engineer and construct an optical\nimager using a wide-beam red laser module, a miniaturized imaging lens, and a CMOS detector, and\nintegrate the bioreceptor-pixelated NHA biosensing chips with the optical imager for field-portable rapid\nmultiplexed testing of infectious pathogens. The overall integrated device is envisioned to be compact (~ 5\n\u00d7 5 \u00d7 10 cm3), light (~ 50 g), and low-cost (~ $ 400 including fabrication and parts). Nanohmics aims at\nrapid (lt 30 minutes) and sensitive detection with limit of detection in the tens to low hundreds of bacteria\nand viruses per mL."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT\nCerebrovascular surgeons performing delicate surgeries such as aneurysm clipping, arteriovenous malformation\nresections, or revascularization procedures could benefit if quantitative information pertaining to the blood flow\nstatus of vessels in their surgical field was made available to them. Current technologies that can monitor blood\nflow at high resolution either use complex dedicated equipment or rely on administration of contrast agents, both\nof which are disruptive to the surgical procedure and hence, undesired. Dye-based techniques like ICG video-\nangiography may not be used frequently and often used only for post-surgical confirmation of surgical success.\nWe propose a novel method that can noninvasively provide real-time information about blood flow in the\nneurosurgeon\u2019s field of view at the spatial scale of microvessels. This modular optical imaging system (called\nthe CVSurgeONTM) will integrate with existing neurosurgical microscopes in operating rooms providing the\nneurosurgeon-user an on-demand video feed of blood flow information to assist in surgical decision-making.\nThis complementary blood flow information will be obtained using proprietary and licensed laser speckle contrast\nimaging technology, and optionally presented to the neurosurgeon in his\/her visual field overlaid on the region\nof interest. We have previously built a prototype of the system and validated its function in small and large animal\nmodels of reversible and irreversible occlusion of vessels in the brain. Our proposed Phase II project aims to\nadapt our technology for clinical use in neurosurgery and then conduct first-in-human studies to validate the\nsystem performance and usefulness in three important types of cerebrovascular surgeries \u2013 aneurysm clipping,\ncauterization of arteriovenous malformations, and cerebrovascular bypass surgery for moyamoya disease."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT\nGlaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in adults worldwide. There is no single instrument that can\ndiagnose glaucoma in all cases requiring a combination of methods including standard automated perimetry to\nassess peripheral vision, optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL)\nthinning, intraocular pressure (IOP), and fundus photography to assess the cup to disc ratio. RNFL changes are\nchallenging to assess in individuals with a high degree of myopia as well as in patients that have previously been\ntreated with laser in the eye. Ocular blood flow (OBF) information from posterior segment, as obtained by an\nFDA-cleared instrument called XyCAM RI developed by us, has the potential to add insights relevant to glaucoma\nstatus that are complementary to conventional methods. Our preliminary results have demonstrated significant\ndifferences in OBF patterns in the optic disc and macular regions in glaucoma subjects and healthy controls. Our\npresent Phase II project seeks to validate the diagnostic potential of OBF metrics obtained by XyCAM RI in the\nmanagement of glaucoma through a rigorous clinical study with age-matched, race-matched, and sex-matched\ncontrols, and specifically demonstrate the usefulness of OBF-derived measurements in assessment of glaucoma\nin highly myopic patients. We also seek to develop and bring to market an enhanced multi-function fundus\ncamera called the XyCAM FC for clinical use. The XyCAM FC will permit practitioners to visualize fundus photos\nin stereo mode to assess cup-to-disc ratio and also OBF information including the most diagnostically relevant\nfeatures. As a frontier technology that complements color fundus images with video data on OBF dynamics at a\nhigh temporal resolution, the XyCAM FC offers the ability to perform reimbursable procedures of fundus\nphotography, enable an ophthalmologist or optometrist to visualize glaucoma pathophysiology, and conduct\nresearch on development of OBF-based biomarkers for ophthalmic and systemic pathology with symptoms in\nthe ocular vasculature."

The new vis-OCT (Aurora X3) by Opticent, Inc. will offer 1.3-\u00b5m axial resolution at an A-line rate of\nup to 250 kHz. The new Aurora X3 system embodies a newly-designed red laser scanning internal eye fixation\nand a fully integrated near-infrared scanning laser ophthalmology with a principally new balanced-detection vis-\nOCT, which approaches shot-noise limited imaging for the first time. The adoption of Aurora X3 will address two\nunmet needs in clinical glaucoma diagnosis and detection of progression: (1) the ability to measure retinal\nsublayer structure and (2) to accurately assess local retinal hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sO2). The earliest\nstructural changes in glaucoma are thought to be retracting retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrites in the inner\nplexiform layer (IPL). Identifying loss of synapses, either by decreased scattering or by the change in IPL\nsublayers\u2019 thicknesses, could serve as an earlier and more sensitive biomarker for glaucoma than any other\nclinical standard. Measuring retinal sO2 and specific arteriole-venule couplets can determine the oxygen\nextraction in the regions served by those vessels, and our preliminary data indicate that regions showing damage\nin glaucomatous eyes have lower oxygen extraction than similar areas in healthy eyes. This observation\nsuggests that such oxygen extraction abnormalities can be measured well beyond the \u201cfloor effect\u201d threshold\nnoted with conventional OCT, allowing assessment of disease beyond the time point that conventional structural\nOCT becomes insensitive. This project will conduct a multi-site clinical test using the latest Aurora X3 clinical\nvis-OCT at New York University, Stanford University, and University of Virginia to validate the proposed IPL and\nsO2 biomarkers in glaucoma."

        "Abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness, affects 18 million people in the US. The\n\u201cwet\u201d form of AMD is characterized by pathological neovascularization and macular bleeding while the \u201cdry\u201d AMD\nform is characterized by no visible vascularization. Strategies to treat wet AMD, including antioxidant therapy,\nprophylactic laser therapy, surgical intervention, and anti-neovascular agents, are primarily palliative and extend\nthe time a patient retains functional vision. All current FDA-approved AMD treatments focus on slowing the\nprogression of the wet stage of the disease by inhibiting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway.\nHowever, wet AMD forms on a background of dry AMD, which always develops before neovascularization. The\ncurrent standard of care for dry AMD reduces the risk of progression from intermediate to advanced AMD by\n~25% but does not prevent onset of AMD. No FDA-approved drug treatments exist for dry AMD. A hallmark of\nAMD is the accumulation of bisretinoids in the lysosomes of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. The most\ncommon bisretinoid, N-retinyl-N-retinylidene ethanolamine (A2E), develops as a byproduct of the visual cycle.\nA2E is cytotoxic in cell culture models and appears to be a causative factor in the formation of lipofuscin.\nLipofuscin bisretinoids are robust and generally not degraded by lysosomal enzymes. Over time, they build up\nand contribute to lysosomal dysfunction and progression of AMD. Strategies to break down accumulated\nlipofuscin have the potential to delay or even reverse dry AMD. Ichor Therapeutics is developing a novel enzyme\ntherapy, which we intend to bring to market as the first FDA-approved dry AMD drug. Based on our breakthrough\ndiscovery that recombinant manganese peroxidase degrades A2E in vitro and in a mouse model of AMD, we\nare expanding this work to identify peroxidases suitable for clinical development. Key characteristics are high\nactivity at lysosomal pH, increased potency for degradation of A2E and related retinoids, amenable to\nengineering for cell and lysosomal delivery, and suitable for large scale production in bacterial systems. The\nscope of our Phase I effort includes: 1) generating and characterizing peroxidases from different microbial\nsources, 2) conjugating optimally performing peroxidases to cell penetrating peptides to optimize targeting to\nRPE cells and subcellular targeting to lysosomes, and 3) evaluating ocular tolerance and biological activity in an\nanimal model of AMD. Successful completion of our objectives will justify IND-enabling studies of our lead\nenzyme in Phase II."

        "Abstract": "Project SummaryUp to half of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) will develop lupus nephritis (LN), and\nnearly a third of LN patients will develop kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplantation. One type of LN,\nmembranous lupus nephritis (MLN) exhibits similar clinical hallmarks and patterns of injury as compared to non-\nlupus associated membranous nephropathy (MN). MN and MLN are largely diagnosed through histopathological\nanalysis of kidney biopsies. Moreover, autoantigens have been identified in MN, with M-type phospholipase A2\nreceptor (PLA2R) autoantibodies present in nearly 70% of cases and thrombospondin type-1 domain containing\n7A (THSD7A) autoantibodies present in approximately 2% of cases. Given the strong connection between these\nautoantibodies and MN, there is significant movement toward eliminating kidney biopsies in patients showing\nserological positivity for autoantibodies against PLA2R and THSD7A. Moreover, serologic tests specific for the\ninciting autoantibody (anti-PLA2R or anti-THSD7A) have proven to be highly valued by nephrologists for\nmonitoring response to therapy and guiding patient care. Reducing the requirement for renal biopsy and\nprogressing towards a precision medicine approach represent dramatic benefits to patients and the US\nhealthcare system, alike. For SLE patients at risk for MLN however, predictive autoantigens are only just now\nbecoming available, with a need for subsequent serological tests. Arkana Laboratories, a leading provider of\nhistopathological and molecular nephrology diagnostics, evaluated a broad range of MLN biopsy samples in an\neffort to identify autoantigens for MLN that may have the same impact as PLA2R and THSD7A have had on non-\nlupus MN diagnostics. Using laser capture microdissection, immune complex elution, mass spectrometry, and\nbioinformatic proteomic analysis, two proteins, Exostosin 1 and Exostosin 2 (EXT1\/2), emerged as candidate\nautoantigens for a subset of MLN. Recently published reports from the Mayo Clinic confirm EXT1\/2 as likely\nautoantigens in MLN. Autoantigenicity was confirmed by staining MLN biopsies for EXT1\/2, which exhibited tight\nco-localization with IgG in the glomerular membrane. EXT1\/2 also co-immunoprecipitated with IgG in extracts\nfrom MLN kidney biopsy tissue. After evaluating over 80 SLE samples, more than 30% were found to be positive\nfor EXT1\/2, with only 1% and 4% exhibiting PLA2R or THSD7A signal, respectively. Interestingly, EXT1\/2\ncirculating autoantibodies have not yet been detected in serological analysis indicating that traditional ELISA-\nbased assays using recombinant proteins to detect autoantibodies may not support an EXT1\/2 diagnostic test\nfor MLN. This Phase I program will therefore employ phage display biopanning, an unbiased screening method\nused to identify high affinity peptide binders, against MLN patient sera and immune complexes from patients with\nexostosin-positive MLN that likely contain EXT1\/2 autoantibodies. Peptides which bind EXT1\/2 autoantibodies\nwill be further refined to maximize affinity and specificity for future Phase II testing as diagnostic reagents."

        "Abstract": "This proposal aims to develop a new generation of swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT)\ntechnology operating at visible wavelengths near 530-600nm for retinal imaging and oximetry. This work will\ndevelop the first swept sources and SS-OCT systems in the visible wavelength range, enabling increased\nsensitivity, imaging range and speed compared to current visible spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) systems with\nsupercontinuum laser sources. Our approach uses novel dispersion engineered, periodically poled Lithium\nNiobate (PPLN) waveguides to achieve broadly tunable second harmonic generation of wavelength swept near\ninfrared (NIR) laser emission from micro-electro-mechanical systems vertical cavity surface emitting lasers\n(MEMS-VCSELs), developed in part under prior NIH grants R44EY022864 and R44CA101067. Combining NIR\nMEMS-VCSELs with advanced PPLN waveguide technology will create a high performance, volume scalable\nvisible swept source for OCT technology. The eight specific aims of this 2.5 year fast track SBIR effort can be\nbroadly divided into swept source development aims, SS-OCT development and imaging aims as follows. Swept\nsource development aims. Praevium will develop a wavelength swept source having a tuning range rt70nm full\nwidth at half maximum (FWHM) and peak power rt8mW (average power ~3mW), overlapping high contrast and\nisosbestic oximetry wavelengths in the 530-600nm range. Praevium will develop new PPLN waveguide designs\nand fabrication technology, achieve record tuning range MEMS-VCSELs in a new wavelength range near 1060-\n1200nm and develop high power broadband semiconductor optical amplifiers matching the new MEMS-VCSEL\nwavelength. Our work will progress through three swept source generations (GEN1, GEN2, GEN3) having the\nfollowing minimum FWHM sweep range\/peak power: GEN1: 20nm\/1mW, GEN2: 40nm\/5mW, and GEN3:\n70nm\/8mW. SS-OCT system development and imaging aims. MIT collaborators will evaluate MEMS-\nVCSEL+PPLN sources from Praevium and develop visible SS-OCT technology for human retinal imaging. Dual\nbalanced detection will be used to increase heterodyne gain and sensitivity, with sweep-by-sweep calibration\nusing two channel acquisition of OCT and calibration signals to achieve uniform sensitivity and resolution over\nlong imaging ranges. These advances promise to achieve A-scan rates of ~400kHz, ~5-10\u00d7 faster than existing\nvisible SD-OCT. MIT collaborators will develop analytical frameworks to compute blood oxygen saturation by\nrefining oximetry methods from visible SD-OCT. Higher speeds and sensitivities promise to enable retinal\ncapillary oximetry and estimating relative blood flow speeds using visible SS-OCT angiography. Finally, working\nwith clinical collaborators in an ongoing NIH program R01EY011289, MIT collaborators will perform visible SS-\nOCT studies in a cohort of normal subjects and patients with diabetic retinopathy to investigate structural and\nfunctional biomarkers using OCT, OCTA and retinal oximetry. This study will assess the feasibility and clinical\nworkflow of visible SS-OCT imaging and determine potential future clinical and research applications."

        "Abstract": "Portable Optical Imager for Multiplexed Foodborne Pathogen Detection\nProject Summary\nFood contamination caused by pathogens is a significant public health concern for consumers worldwide.\nCritical aspects of limiting foodborne disease outbreaks and epidemic involve early detection and rapid\ndiagnostics of foodborne pathogens which require sensitive, multiplexed devices that enable point-of-care\n(POC) diagnostics. New generations of rapid (detection in minutes to hours), portable, multiplexed and\nsensitive biosensors can significantly aid in delivery of a safer food supply.\nNanohmics proposes to develop a low-cost portable optical imager that is capable of fast (lt 30\nminutes), sensitive (tens to hundreds of bacteria or viruses), and multiplexed testing of up to tens of\nfoodborne pathogens from fresh produce swab fluids or rinsates and comparable food surface\nsamples. Specifically, the proposed research will integrate low-cost large-area pixelated nanohole\narray (NHA) biosensing chips and economical optical and electronical components in to a compact,\nhighly portable, battery-operated and rugged biosensor device. While NHA plasmonic biosensors\nalready exist as bench-level laboratory experimental set ups, the technology has not been innovated to make\nit portable and multiplexed for field use to test numerous imported or domestic foods onsite where the FDA\nand USDA are overwhelmed with samples. Compared to conventional reflection-type plasmonic biosensors\nemploying a prism, NHAs support collinear excitation and collection configuration. This not only\nsignificantly simplifies alignment and but also enables small footprint and highly multiplexed biosensing.\nNanohmics will microspot NHA-based pixel arrays with different bioreceptors where the type of target is\nencoded in the position of the corresponding spot pixels. The team will engineer and construct an optical\nimager using a wide-beam red laser module, a miniaturized imaging lens, and a CMOS detector, and\nintegrate the bioreceptor-pixelated NHA biosensing chips with the optical imager for field-portable rapid\nmultiplexed testing of infectious pathogens. The overall integrated device is envisioned to be compact (~ 5\n\u00d7 5 \u00d7 10 cm3), light (~ 100 g), and low-cost (~ $ 400 including fabrication and parts). Nanohmics aims at\nrapid (lt 30 minutes) and sensitive detection with limit of detection in the tens to low hundreds of bacteria\nand viruses per mL."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nLED Radiofluidics is developing an apparatus that allows direct or easy conversion of small molecule drug\ncandidates to positron emission tomography (PET) agents via radiofluorination with a readily accessible, and\ninexpensive LED light source. PET is a powerful, rapidly developing technology that plays key roles in medical\nimaging, as well as drug discovery and development. Despite the exceptional promise, the availability of novel\nPET agents is limited due to the lack of efficient and simple labeling methods to modify biologically active small\nmolecules\/drugs. Many small molecule pharmaceuticals and therapeutics contain aromatic or heteroaromatic\nsystems within their framework; thus, it would be highly desirable for radiolabels to be introduced to this common\norganic subunit easily and efficiently.\nUnfortunately, current methods to radiofluorinate inactivated arene compounds have only limited success, and\noften requires complicated synthesis to access the desired precursors and\/or special O2-free handling\ntechniques. Progress has been made however, with photoredox systems developed by the Nicewicz and Li\ngroups at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; their work describes arene C\u2013H fluorination with 18F \u2013\nthat allows direct conversion of drugs to PET agents. They also have determined that the nucleophilic aromatic\nsubstitution (SNAr) and halogen exchange reactions can precisely control the radiofluorination position on\naromatic substrates when conducting radiofluorination of C-OR2 or C-X (X = F, Cl, Br, I, NO2) bonds. While these\napproaches offer simple, efficient late stage radiofluorination, both methods require an expensive laser light\nsource, and it is anticipated that the setup could be difficult to automate. However, LED Radiofluidics\u2019 innovative\nand affordable device, using an inexpensive light source (~$200) can offer an answer for the unmet need for\ndiverse PET agents via our photoredox-based development of radiofluorinated PET agents.\nThe goal of this application is to establish feasibility of the envisioned radiofluorination device as a first step\ntoward making this paradigm shifting technology readily available to the field. The specific aims of this Phase I\nproject are: 1: To develop a prototype device based on flow reaction and microfluidics using an LED as the light\nsource, with the goal of greatly reducing the cost of the light reactor without compromising radiolabeling yields.\nAn initial module supporting synthesis of an [18F]F-DOPA derivative will be co-developed with the device, such\nthat this well-established photoredox radiolabeling reaction can be demonstrated and optimized on the device,\nand 2: To demonstrate the ability of the concept by fluorinating members of a class of existing small molecule\npharmaceuticals. Informed by the initial design established in Aim 1, the three synthetic methods identified will\nbe developed and tested in the device built in Aim 1. LED Radiofluidics hypothesize the microfluidic device will\ngreatly increase the surface area exposed to the light source, leading to increased yields compared to traditional\nset-ups."

Following the US\nFDA guidelines, the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and toxicity of Photobac in various doses\nwere also investigated in mice, rats and dogs. Histopathology results did not show any organ toxicity. Photobac\neven at a 20-fold higher than the therapeutic dose (single dose needed for the treatment) was not lethal. No\nmetabolite formation and organ toxicity even at higher than the desired therapeutic dose was observed. The\nbiodistribution of C-14 Photobac at variable time points was also determined in mice and rats [7, 8]. Results\nwith C-14 Photobac in rats and fluorescence results in mice suggest that Photobac crosses the blood brain\nbarrier (BBB).A positive pre-IND response from the US FDA on our request for the use of Photobac to treat Gliomas was\npleasing and exciting (Application # PIND 136905). As suggested by the FDA review committee, the revision of\nhuman patient Phase I protocol has been accomplished. NIR PS Photobac has also received an \u201cOrphan\nDrug\u201d status from the US FDA for imaging and therapy of Glioblastoma (fluorescence-guided surgery +\nPDTof recurrence tumors) (# DRU-2017-6153), which further encouraged us to move this technology to\nPhase I human clinical trials. To achieve our goal, the proposed study (SBIR: Preclinical and Clinical)) has\nbeen divided into following aims:\nAim 1 (a): To investigate the PDT efficacy of Photobac in rat glioma model and using Simphotek\u2019s proprietary\ncomputational device FPDosi\u2122 (Beeson et al. J. Biomed. Opt. 24(3), 035006, 2019) compare light dose to\nexperiments. Details are presented in the letter of support from Simphotek. Aim 1 (b): To compile the\nPhotobac CMC (chemistry, manufacturing and control), drug-formulation, stability of drug substance and drug\nproduct, analytical details, PK\/PD, toxicity, in vitro and in vivo data and Phase I clinical protocol for an IND\nsubmission to the US FDA for fluorescence image guided surgery + PDT of glioblastoma. The cost of the IND\nsubmission will be paid by Photolitec, LLC.\nAim 2: To compile the details of PS (Photobac)-customized NIR laser instrument (787 nm, developed with the\nhelp of Biolitec) following the US FDA guidelines, and submit it for approval (combined IND-Aim 1].\nAim 3: To perform Phase I trial with Photobac-PDT, fluorescence-guided treatment (surgery + PDT) of\nglioblastoma at a single light dose and variable drug doses for selecting the best treatment parameters.\nAim 4: To provide tissue samples from glioblastoma, corresponding non-tumor tissue, untreated tumors,\nPhotobac-PDT treated tumors and recurrent tumors after previous surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and\nchemotherapy treatment, for Photobac specificity using 3D cell-culture system, and STAT3 crosslinks analysis.\nAim 5: Establish a correlation between the cell-uptake on patients\u2019 tumors (at various stages) implanted in\nmice, photo-induced STAT3 dimerization and a long-term PDT response [7]. Translate these findings to\nenhance the optimal treatment parameter(s) of glioblastoma patients."

        "Abstract": "AbstractSecretory proteins are fundamental to local and systemic cellular signaling in biological systems.\nThe regulation and dysregulation of the networks involving these proteins plays a critical role in\nhealth, aging, and development of disease. As such, study of these proteins and their networks\nis critical to our understanding of biology. Not surprisingly, this particular set of proteins constitutes\na large proportion of the targets of pharmaceutical drugs, and also represents attractive targets\nfor diagnostics and future precision medicine efforts. Unfortunately, many of these secreted\nproteins are difficult to detect. There are existing technologies for studying these secreted proteins\nbut they either underperform, are extremely expensive and\/or complex given their specific-utility.\ncontaining multiple cell types. Although the need to study secreted proteins is ubiquitous, there\nis not a technology that is widely available (inexpensive) and capable of providing\ninformation on multiple secreted proteins simultaneously at single-cell resolution, and we\naim to address this need in the current project.At the core of our technologies is the Plasmonic Fluor (PF), our proprietary, ultrabright\nfluorescent nanoconstruct designed to enhance the performance of fluorescence-based\nimmunoassays. We have already built a high-sensitivity, multiplexed immunoassay platform\nleveraging this technology, which is currently being tested with external collaborators. This\nplatform includes an inexpensive, high performance, single-laser fluorescence microplate\/slide\nreader optimized for use with our PFs. We will extend this existing platform to accommodate PF-\nenhanced cellular secretion assays we call PFluorospot. The upgraded platform that will result\nfrom the proposed effort will be a truly versatile and powerful tool for the measurement of\nproteins.In our preliminary work, we have successfully manufactured at commercial scale and with high\nreproducibility streptavidin-conjugated PFs that are spectrally equivalent to FITC, Cy3, and Cy5\n(PF490, PF550, and PF650, respectively). We have also created three PFs with entirely unique\nexcitation\/emission spectra: two which have excitation spectra like FITC and emit like Cy3 and\nCy5 (PF490_550 and PF490_650, respectively), and one which has an excitation spectrum like Cy3 but\nemits like Cy5 (PF550_650). These unique PFs were synthesized at a prototype scale which we aim\nto scale up in this effort because they will allow 3 lasers to be used to interrogate 6 separate\ntargets. In a demonstration of applicability to cellular secretion assays, streptavidin-PF550 and\nPF650 were conjugated to antibodies at a small scale and used to perform dual-color PFluorospot.\nThese initial PFluorospot experiments show that additional information can be obtained in these\nassays relative to ELISPOT\/FluoroSpot, and are simpler and significantly faster to perform. It was\npossible to visualize individual cells for adherent cells and better localize secreting cells. This is\nparticularly important for understanding heterogeneity, spatial effects in co-culture, and\npolyfunctionality, and we propose to add a 4th laser to our reader to accommodate cell markers.\nAdditionally, a single-color PFluorospot assay was read with our existing reader and\ndemonstrated high sensitivity, high resolution, and short read times.We believe our Pfluorospot platform and reader will become the go-to secretomics platform, and\nwill empower many more biological researchers to measure important, secreted proteins."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe goal of our project is to further develop the tracking scanning laser ophthalmoscope\n(TSLO), the Retitrack device, to enable widespread use of the technology for high-resolution eye-\ntracking for head injuries, such as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)\/concussions. Phase I of this\ngrant enabled the collection of data from 50 patients who had recently been diagnosed with a\nconcussion both during their acute recovery period and upon clearance. Accounting for age and\ntime since injury, fixational eye motion metrics were able to predict individuals with prolonged\nrecovery (AUC=0.81; 95% CI: 0.68-0.93; plt0.001). The Retitrack brings an unprecedented level\nof accuracy of eye tracking to the clinic by using an image-based retinal approach resulting in\nmotion measurements with a sensitivity of 0.25 arcmin (~1 micron). Currently, this system is the\nmost accurate, fast and functional eye-tracking system used in a standard ophthalmic instrument.\nResearch has suggested that pupil eye-tracking technologies have validated the idea of using\neye movements as a biomarker of concussion, but the current eye-trackers available lack the\ncapacity, repeatability, and sensitivity to predict recovery in mTBI. The Retitrack device can\naccurately measure fixational eye movements (FEMs), quantify retinal saccades at an\nunprecedented level, and can become an emerging biomarker of mTBI prognosis. Furthermore,\nit can serve as an indicator of severity in the symptomatology of multiple other neurological\ndisorders. The Retitrack device as a concussive prognostic tool would be the perfect fit for Sport\nMedicine Clinics and the locker room for post-concussion recovery monitoring ensuring a safe\nreturn to activity and mitigating long-term consequences of concussion by guiding the most\neffective therapies. Further optimization of fixational tasks and the construction of innovative\nsoftware that uses Artificial Intelligence algorithms to automatically quantify retinal microsaccades\nwhich will lead to the improvement of predicting the recovery and\/or worsening of concussion."

        "Abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThis project seeks to develop a multi-probe ultrathin endomicroscope to enable high-resolution imaging and\nphoto-stimulation at multiple sites within currently inaccessible regions of the brain. The instrument will be\namenable to scientific studies in model animals and a stepping stone for future medical instrumentation targeted\nat diagnosis and disease treatment in humans.\nThe company addresses the critical need in the scientific and medical fields for endoscopes that are minimally\ninvasive, with a cross section in the order of 100\u03bcm. The proposed system prototype will be digitally programmed,\ncontain no moving parts, and simultaneously address multiple probes that penetrate tissue with negligible\ndamage. The target application is deep brain imaging and photo-stimulation simultaneously in multiple regions\nof the brain. The system will enable imaging difficult-to-reach brain areas, such as the brain stem or the olfactory\nbulb, with negligible trauma to the animal. The possibility of inserting multiple imaging probes to correlate stimulation\nand activity in different regions of the brain could provide new understanding of the connectome and help observe\ndifferences between healthy and diseased brains.\nCurrent endoscopic solutions are appropriate for insertion in large cavities but they produce excessive damage\nin applications such as deep brain imaging. This project will create a minimally\u2013invasive, robust, flexible, and\ncompact prototype for multi-probe endomicroscopy. The key innovation is in achieving the fundamentally thinnest\nmechanism to transmit a high information content image in real time and in parallelizing it to multiple brain sites.\nThe individual probes have a cross-area 10 times smaller than the thinnest existing endoscopes. Further, each\nof the probes will be able to deliver multiple functions: 3D imaging with micrometer resolution, fluorescence and\nreflection imaging, as well as laser pattern generation for photo-stimulation and ablation.\nThe imaging approach implements wavefront shaping in various multimode fiber probes simultaneously, using\nadvanced machine learning and signal processing methods, to generate arbitrary digitally-reprogrammable light\npatterns and 3D images. The system uses a spatial light modulator to first calibrate each fiber and then scan\nlight at high speed, compensating for the inherent modal dispersion and intermodal coupling.\nThe demonstration of the first in-vivo imaging and optogenetics experiments through a multimode fiber, showing\npopulations of neurons individually imaged at depth, with subcellular resolution, and with minimal tissue damage,\nopens exciting opportunities for expansion and development into mullti-probe multi-modality systems. The\ncompany\u2019s initial focus is on de-risking and validating the use of multimode fiber probes in animal functional\nneuro-imaging. The long-term vision is to translate the technology towards medical applications."

Given a LWS has graduated effects from dazzle to destroy, low engagement cost, and nearly unlimited depth of magazine it has great promise for other mission areas. These new and sophisticated LWS capabilities require a highly effective and usable operator console and Human-Machine Interface (HMI) so that the Laser Weapons Control Operator (LWCO) can effectively manage and control the wide variety of tasking for which the system is designed. Developing this new console and its HMI poses a number of human factors challenges that Pacific Science &amp; Engineering (PSE) has the experience and expertise to address. A new console in the Combat Information Center (CIC) will require a detailed workflow analysis and thoughtful design to ensure the development of a usable system for the Laser Weapons Control Operator (LWCO) watchstander position. PSE proposes to apply its proven UCD process for IWS 2.0 to the development of an LWCO HMI for the future DE system and future program of record. PSE proposes four main objectives across the Phase II Base and Option: Extend, refine, and mature the existing high energy laser with integrated optical-dazzler and surveillance (HELIOS) prototype via human factors support to government lab (Phase II Base). Develop and refine mockups and interactive prototype for the future DE Increment (Inc) 2 system based on planned and future capabilities with (Created in Phase II Base and updated in Phase II Option I). Document the DE system design with (a) a functional description document (FDD) to facilitate implementation by a prime developer \/ Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), and (Phase II Option I) (b) create a DE program style guide with (Created in Phase II Base and updated in Phase II Option). Demonstrate, test, and validate the DE prototype (Phase II Option I) As part of the UCD process, PSE will develop a number of key products and artifacts to ultimately inform the development of the future DE Inc 2 system: Workflows, Personas, and Scenarios Style Guidance Designs and Prototyping Prioritized Recommendations Evaluation \/ Human\u00a0Performance Studies PSE\u2019s guiding philosophy and specialization is to bring science and analytic rigor to the analysis and development of end user tools and displays. Through its experiences reviewed above, working on Navy advanced development systems for decades, it has constantly striven to bring thoughtful, carefully reasoned, and rigorous products that represent end user domain task and cognitive requirements to bear to influence development of new capabilities."

        "Abstract": "Hybrid Metal additive manufacturing (AM) is difficult. Residual stresses from directed energy deposition (DED) and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) processes can be very information-dense. Infill patterns can greatly affect the residual stress distribution, and thus deformation, in the finished component. Subtractive manufacturing (SM) processes, such as milling, upset the balance of long-range residual stresses, as well as introduce new stresses at the cut surface. The majority of the academic work studying residual stresses from metal AM and machining processes is expository. They explain what the residual stresses are but lack an actionable plan to fix the issue. The key innovation proposed here is a framework by which the complex stress states produced by hybrid AM\/SM processes can be addressed by two-stage optimization created with a unified set of simulation and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) tools."

        "Abstract": "The Department of Navy (DON) needs an inexpensive lidar-like 3D imaging sensors that have high depth and lateral resolution, have a large field-of view for reliable object detection, respond in real time, and work at medium to long ranges in indoor and outdoor environments. This need can be met by combining stereovision with an adaptive laser range finding array that can selectively increase the resolution of the point clouds in desired regions of interest at far-off distances. This proposal presents a plan to develop a Target Detection and Adaptive Ranging (TDAR) sensor with advanced Machine Learning (ML) based target detection algorithms-in-the-loop. This approach effectively combines the advantages (FOV, fps, point-cloud data) of the vision-based and LIDAR-based target detections, while omitting its drawbacks (stereo disparity, computationally expensive algorithms, expensive hardware) to achieve high resolution point cloud data at near and far ranges. The innovation of the TDAR sensor is the adaptive ranging that only generates high-resolution point cloud data of relevant targets that are rapidly detected by the stereo vision. This advantage allows the TDAR sensor to have low cost, SWAP, and computation requirements, in addition to the increased resolution."

        "Abstract": "Knowledge of the local three-dimensional environment is critical for effective mission execution, particularly for autonomous vehicles. LIDAR optical ranging and imaging offers the potential to improve ranging speed and accuracy. LIDAR ranging provides a high-fidelity geometric representation of the environment, with reflectivity strength preserving optical contrast, two features very useful for automatic target recognition (ATR). However, optical solutions are limited by water turbidity, which scatters light and limits the effect range and resolution of LIDAR underwater. Creare proposes to develop the high-resolution underwater LIDAR (HRUL). The HRUL features flexible conditioning and processing of the received optical return that adaptively adjusts the optical processing scheme to maximize ranging resolution for the local water turbidity. Modern advances in pulsed fiber lasers, optical modulation, optical sensing, time-of-flight calculation, and embedded processing allow the HRUL to achieve mission-relevant area coverage rates (order 1 million three-dimensional points per second) and ranging resolution (sub-centimeter) in a low size, weight, and power package suitable for integration with an autonomous undersea vehicle (AUV). In Phase I we will demonstrate our novel optical processing approach and in Phase II we will build a full-scale system for integration with an AUV."

Advantages include economical low volume production and rapid design iteration due to elimination of die tooling and the ability to manufacture complex features such as conformal cooling channels into structurally optimized components. However, AM of rhenium has not been developed to a production ready scale owing in part to high material costs. In this Phase II effort, Elementum 3D proposes to develop a full solution for AM production of complex rhenium components. This work will include development of: AM feedstock powder specification and supply chain establishment, production scale laser powder bed fusion AM process for high-quality printing of rhenium components, heat treatment processes, and component finishing. Work will also include material property testing and component level testing culminating in the hot fire of a printed rhenium propulsion component."

        "Abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) of metals is a relatively recent advancement with proven benefits for production of many complex critical components and great potential for performance, readiness, and cost improvements with growing use. Most of todays known alloys have been developed for other processes like casting or forging and only a relatively small number of alloys have been adapted for AM processes. Fusion based AM processes introduce extreme thermal gradients and cooling rates and many alloys designed for wrought processing suffer from cracking and other defects when printed. Even for alloys that have proven to be printable, anisotropic properties typically result from elongated grains in the growth direction and properties may not match those of wrought parts. In this project, we propose\u00a0to develop, validate, and use integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) framework to create new designed-for-AM alloys that offer improved printability, performance, and reliability compared to existing options. The key to development of improved AM alloys is understanding and control of nucleation and solidification to produce the targeted microstructure. Strengthening mechanisms will also be included in computational modeling and experimental development. In Phase I, modeling\u00a0efforts demonstrated that addition of nucleation inoculants would be more effective at controlling grain growth and eliminating cracking than in-specification composition modifications, and we demonstrated this experimentally in crack-prone Haynes 230. Multiple inoculant formulations resulted in crack-free microstructures with high temperature yield strength improved by 60% compared to the wrought equivalent. In this Phase II effort, we will extend the Phase I work to improve models for predicting as-printed grain size, post- heat treatment microstructure development, and creep behavior. We will also investigate model-guided formulations for eliminating solidification cracking in gamma-prime containing alloys IN738 and Mar-M-247. After validation in laser powder bed fusion AM systems and formulation refinement,\u00a0expanded specimen and component level testing will be done to evaluate the performance of these alloys in an actual gas turbine.\u00a0 The improved alloys developed in this project will be offered commercially for use by manufacturers and end-users including the U.S. Navy, defense industrial base, and private sector customers."

        "Abstract": "The Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) is the layer of atmosphere bordering the surface of the earth and represents the greatest importance to human activities. It is also the most difficult layer of the atmosphere to measure directly. These dual properties of high importance yet difficulty of measurement have led some people in the atmospheric profiling community to call a space-based measurement approach to a complete profile of PBL properties the Holy Grail of atmospheric profiling. In recent years it has received tremendous attention given the importance and difficulty of the problem. According to the NASA PBL Incubation Study Team Report: \u201cA global Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) observing system is urgently needed to address fundamental PBL science questions and societal applications related to weather, climate, and air quality\u201d [Teixeira, J. et al, 2021]. In addition to the needs outlined in the report, 4S experience in developing Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) devices under contract from NAVAIR has led to an understanding that the technology stands to benefit from high resolution models and forecasts to predict atmospheric conditions that degrade laser beam quality. The Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) has greater complications with high variability over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales due to high horizontal heterogeneity introduced by mesoscale ocean phenomena. Additionally, in situ observations of the MABL are sparse when compared to land based in situ observations. A complete observational approach that accounts for the ocean, the MABL thermodynamic structure, and clouds is required to properly profile the MABL."

        "Abstract": "This project addresses the need to access and control extreme temperature sample environments that are used in many research applications at neutron beamline facilities. Research on advanced materials is hampered by difficulty in accessing short-lived metastable states that play a crucial role in determining the material&apos;s ultimate structure and properties. This project will lead to development of a novel sample environment and event-based data processing technologies that will enable studies of materials under extreme conditions that relate to production of semiconductors, optical glasses, medical device materials and energy conversion materials. Integration of simultaneous atomic structure and materials property measurements provides a unique and much needed capability to develop new advanced materials. In combination with advanced sample environments, high flux neutron sources such as SNS provide an opportunity to revolutionize advanced materials research. Processing and solidifying liquids is a critical value adding step in manufacturing semiconductors, optical materials, metals and in the operation of many energy-conversion and medical devices. Research will be performed jointly by the small business and the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The proposed solution is to integrate a novel containerless sample environment and an event-based data acquisition system with a high flux neutron beamline and non-contact measurements of density, viscosity and surface tension of liquids. The use of laser beam heating allows rapid heating (100 K\/s) and cooling to access metastable states that cannot be obtained using a conventional furnace. The R&amp;D will: (i) fully commission the alpha prototype into the user program, (ii) develop and construct a beta prototype instrument, (iii) integrate simultaneous measurements of atomic structure and thermophysical properties, and (iv) establish commercial presence for the instrument, launch product and initiate sales. The product of this R&amp;D will be a beamline facility and a research instrument that will be marketed by direct interaction with customers. The proposed system has direct applications in neutron facilities such as SNS, HFIR, ESS, ISIS and other sources. The approach is also suitable for marketing to X-ray facilities where there are additional markets for instruments based on the proposed technology. Combined structure\/property measurements respond to a market need in industrial and university materials research. Prior sales of extreme environment instruments has been several M$."

        "Abstract": "Fuel contamination is a global problem that has severe consequences for both Air Force and commercial flight operations. Contaminated fuel substantially increases the wear and tear on engines, degrading performance, damaging aircraft, and potentially causing engine failure. Solid particulate and free water contamination are the leading jet fuel contaminant issues as identified by the Air Force and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Particulate matter clogs vital components, reducing both engine efficiency and performance, and can obstruct flow in the engine\u2019s fuel-line system leading to the loss of aircraft availability and increasing maintenance lifecycle costs. Free water promotes microbial growth and rust, with the same detrimental effects as particulate matter, and can freeze leading to ice blockages and other aircraft-threatening issues. Prevention of solid particulate and free water contamination is very difficult to achieve as fuel must travel long distances from the refinery to the tank of an aircraft. As it makes its way through multiple storage containers and pipelines, it is inevitably exposed to moisture, scale, and dirty air. As total prevention of this exposure is nearly impossible, it is critical that quality control measures are put in place to ensure fuel is suitable for use before it is pumped into aircraft. For military operations conducted at DoD controlled locations, this is a relatively minor issue as large air bases have robust quality control systems. However, for operations conducted at remote non-DoD controlled locations solid particulate and free water contamination is a critical issue as quality control methods are limited by the availability of lab equipment and presence of trained personnel. These conditions significantly increase the likelihood of contaminated fuel entering aircraft, leading to greater maintenance costs, reduced availability of aircraft, and potential engine failure. Using modern optical techniques in a dual approach, FQMT will enable Air Force personnel to verify and confirm jet fuel quality before refueling, at DOD controlled locations or in austere environments, without sophisticated laboratory equipment or specialized training. FQMT uses compact solid-state laser diagnostics to measure water and particulate contaminants rapidly and accurately. Mid-IR Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) based spectroscopy determines the fuel\u2019s water count while advanced spectroscopic techniques isolate\/separate the free and dissolved water. Forward Mie scattering is then employed to estimate particle contaminant levels and distribution, as well as to provide a secondary estimate of free water. The result is a highly accurate, easy to use, and portable device that can be effectively operated by all on-site personnel."

        "Abstract": "Data-driven materials design is a burgeoning field with the potential to rapidly accelerate new materials development, provided that large volumes of data can be efficiently generated and analyzed. The Department of Defense (DoD) is interested in data-driven design of next-generation protection materials. However, ballistic evaluation of protection materials presents a significant bottleneck: due to safety concerns and stringent testing requirements, full-scale ballistic tests are expensive and generate data at a very low rate, on the order of 10 samples\/day. Sub-scale ballistic testing offers a potential alternative without such limitations, by using dramatically smaller projectiles and smaller samples to improve safety, reduce expense, and significantly increase throughput. However, to meet the demands of data-driven materials design, sub-scale testing techniques will require advancements in several areas: rate of data collection and processing, automation of analysis, development of up-scaling relationships, and development of test standards. Revolutionary development in this area presents tremendous opportunity to develop new materials an order of magnitude faster while requiring an order of magnitude less material. The goal of this effort is to develop a sub-scale ballistic testing platform as a critical tool for data-driven, high-throughput design and characterization of next-generation protection materials. This goal will be met during Phase I through the following technical objectives: (1) Develop modified Laser-Induced Particle Impact Test (LIPIT) method that employs a multi-cell design fixture; (2) Conduct subscale tests with miniature gas gun test device and draft scaling relationships; (3) Evaluate performance limits of new test methods via computational modeling and proof-of-concept testing; (4) Develop fixture automation and automated data processing plan for Phase II."

        "Abstract": "In this STTR Phase I proposal, Kent Optronics and its partner Vanderbilt University propose to develop a monolithic fast speed self-responsive (passive) optical limiter comprising an array of Vanadium dioxide (VO2) thin film coated elements. It locally blocks dangerous laser via redirecting the laser beam mechanism, leading to an optical density (OD) &gt; 6. The limiter has femtosecond (fs) response time due to the ultrafast VO2 phase transition.\u00a0 When no laser, its 70% linear transmission enables high throughput for normal sensor operation.\u00a0 The on-set laser blocking fluence threshold is 400X lower than most EO-IR sensors in the field.\u00a0The limiter is reversible meaning its transmission returns to 70% once the laser disappears.\u00a0The limiter is spectrally agile to block arbitrary single and multiple laser wavelengths simultaneously in the visible to short wave infrared.\u00a0 Phase I efforts are to design and evaluate the technology via a feasibility study to finalize the limiter design against the design goals. In Phase II, a formal optical limiter prototype will be developed, qualified and delivered, reach TRL&gt;6."

        "Abstract": "Asphalt is the bedrock of our nation\u2019s transportation and logistics infrastructure. In the US alone, 85 to 90 percent of all runways at our nation&apos;s 3,364 commercial airports are surfaced with asphalt pavement. But, airfield asphalt is expensive as it requires significant upfront capital investment, constant maintenance and repair, and replacement every 15 to 20 years due to normal wear and tear, climate effects, and product lifespan.\u00a0 Preservation of these pavement runways is significantly more cost effective than replacement and reconstruction. Robotic crack sealing of airbase pavements provides an effective, efficient means for extending pavement life while reducing manual labor, safety concerns and maintenance equipment needs. necoTech is acting as the catalyst to advance existing pavement technologies through the use of robotic applications adapted with an autonomous vehicle to directly support USAF runway crack sealing and pavement maintenance needs. This technology will extend the life of airbase pavement by providing an efficient, lower-cost means for routine repair of cracks and damage as it occurs. necoTech is dedicated to reducing the overall footprint of necessary infrastructure repair and construction, including the evolution of machinery and equipment. Our approach represents the convergence of existing, standard infrastructure repair technologies with machine learning technologies that result in higher-quality application with less waste and less reliance on human labor. We hold a DoD license to pursue the development of robotic technologies for use in aerospace applications. Our planned approach is to mount a robotic arm on a traditional truck chassis. Using AI, this robotic technology uses the following procedure for crack repair: Laser Identification of existing pavement crack using Machine Learning (ML) Upon affirmative crack identification, the robot will blow debris out of the crack, preparing it for crack sealing material. Using AI, apply prepared crack sealing materials with better material control currently available in the industry. In addition to providing better quality and longer lasting crack sealing, our technology offers efficiencies not currently found in the industry.\u00a0 As envisioned, our application is capable of repairing a half mile an hour on a four-lane road, twice as fast as the industry standard."

The team will address a series of technical challenges identified by 1) scaling up the coating of multiple layers including perovskites and charge transport layers by continuous deposition process on flexible substrates, 2) reducing cell-to-module efficiency loss using advanced module structure combined with new laser scribing tools and methods; 3) addressing new degradation mechanism in perovskite modules which do not exist in cells, and 4) developing encapsulation and packaging of flexible solar modules with low cost. The project will involve a broad spectrum of innovations involving ink formulation, device design, and fabrication methods This project will leverage the US-MAP program led by NREL and facility at NRL on the measurement of efficiency as well as environmental stability of perovskite modules."

        "Abstract": "To address the Navy\u2019s need for a new sensor for marine wave boundary turbulence and atmosphere characterization in submarines, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (Intellisense) proposes to advance the development of the Submarine Active Meteorological Sensor (SAMS), which utilizes light backscattering in the atmosphere to measure atmospheric parameters in the marine boundary layer. Specifically, the innovation in the sensor\u2019s optical scheme and the use of a stable high-energy short-pulse laser will enable the SAMS to measure the distribution of multiple atmospheric parameters over distance with a single optical aperture and several laser pulses. In Phase I, Intellisense successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the SAMS technology through design and simulation of the SAMS operation. In Phase II, Intellisense plans to design and fabricate a fully integrated prototype system for remote turbulence measurements over the ocean surface. The prototype\u2019s operation will be demonstrated at a test range that includes a measurement path over the ocean. Results of measurements will be compared with data collected from commercial scintillometers."

        "Abstract": "Traditional flight termination systems (FTS) rely on a man-in-the-loop to monitor vehicle flight path and related vehicle trajectory performance parameters based on multiple radar tracking sources along with sensory data sent from onboard the vehicle via telemetry. An autonomous flight safety system (AFSS) brings the decision process onboard the vehicle via digital high-speed processing of positional data coming from onboard sensors, such as global positioning system (GPS), Optical (star or sun trackers), laser, and\/or inertial measurement system (IMU)sensors. The sensor type is flexible in the architecture, but may require a software adjustment for the sensors position, velocity, and time(PVT) transmission formats. The Range Safety (RS) preprogrammed flight path and keep-out areas, along with flight deviation allowances, and related safety rules are uploaded to the AFSS prior to launch and stored in protective computer memory. The AFSS continuously determines the instantaneous impact point (IIP) of the vehicle based on real-time navigation data obtained from the onboard sensors. Current AFSS have been primarily designed for pad-launched systems; however, submarine-launched missiles present some unique issues that must be considered when leveraging this existing technology"

        "Abstract": "The United States Navy (USN) desires a means to remotely measure the temperature and sound velocity of ocean water in the near-surface region where the temperature is most variable. Aret\u00e9 proposes to accomplish this objective with a blue\/green LiDAR system that spectrally resolves the Brillouin component of the backscattered light. Aret\u00e9 is calling the proposed capability the Brillouin Ocean LiDAR Technology System (BOLTS). In recent years, laser and optical spectroscopic technologies have advanced to the point where commercial components for a Brillouin LiDAR sensor are becoming available. Aret\u00e9 proposes to develop BOLTS using a kilohertz-pulsed fiber laser transmitter; Brillouin spectrometer; and a gated, intensified CMOS camera to measure the entire spectrum of backscattered light within a 5 meter \u201crange gate\u201d in depth and thus determine the Brillouin frequency shift to high accuracy. Under this Phase II Base and Option, Aret\u00e9 will support a Preliminary and Critical Design, develop a prototype comprised of hardware and software Digital Signal Processing (DSP) solutions identified under the Phase I, and perform a data collection\/demonstration of the prototype system in a representative environment. Exiting the Phase II Program, Aret\u00e9 plans for a TRL 5\/6 capability."

This advanced imager will feature a Type 2 Strained Layer Superlattice (T2SLS) detector optimized for detection of 2.0 to 2.1 \u00c2\u00b5m wavelength light. Dark currents will be less than 0.1 nA\/pixel at -40\u00c2\u00b0C. A custom readout integrated circuit will be designed and fabricated that will measure both time of flight and amplitude of the return signal. The hybridized focal plane array (FPA) will have low noise detection allowing a signal to noise ratio of 1 from 10 photons of return signal, provide 10 cm range resolution out to 10 km range, and operate at 500 fps. The imager design will be architected so that it can be fabricated in larger formats, such as 1280x1024 or larger, in future fabrication runs with no degradation in the above performance parameters."

        "Abstract": "Highly engineered ceramic coatings, called thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), have been used for many years in the gas turbine industry, and more recently, in internal combustion engines for automotive, truck, and construction vehicle applications. These coatings increase the performance and durability of the engines. The gas turbine industry has shown that coating thickness variations are major sources of variation in coating and component service lives. To define and control service life, there is a strong need to be able to measure coating thickness during processing, especially on components with a small radius of curvature. The goal of the proposed program is to demonstrate a laser-induced ultrasonic coating thickness measurement system capable of measuring relatively thin (25-350 \u03bcm) ceramic coatings, with a spot size less than 1 mm. Applications include both postcoating part inspection and real-time measurement during thermal spray. The SST proposed measurement system will consist of a pulsed laser to excite ultrasonic waves in the coating, and a continuous probe laser to monitor the resulting surface oscillations. The propagation time of the wave through the coating is directly related to its thickness."

        "Abstract": "We propose to develop a three-dimensional (3D) mid-infrared (mid-IR) Photonic Lantern (PL) based on femtosecond laser inscription (FLI) technology. FLI of PLs allows converting the atmospheric seeing-limited signals captured by the telescope into diffraction-limited signals. A linear arrangement of the single-mode outputs can be further realized to form the virtual input slit of a spectrograph. The inherent 3D nature, scalability, and the ability to integrate many on-chip functions make FLI an attractive fabrication technique for photonic integrated circuits (PIC), as opposed to the multi-step planar waveguide technologies relying on costly, large-scale microelectronics foundry techniques. The FLI of a 3D, 1x8, mid-infrared waveguide beam splitter and a 1x8 photonic lantern will be demonstrated during the project#39;s Phase I and II period. Three technical objectives are defined: 1:nbsp; Determine the optimum geometry for a 1x8 waveguide splitter. Objective. 2:nbsp; Experimentally investigate the impact of laser parameters and WBS geometry on WBS performance. .and 3:nbsp; Demonstrate a 1x8 waveguide beam splitter operating in the mid-infrared region. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish an FLI technology platform for fabricating integrated photonic circuits.The FLI-based, low SWaP PIC technology will be useful for NASA in lidar receiver for new Earth Science measurements such as the detection of carbon monoxide, free-space laser communications, mid-infrared heterodyne spectroscopy, and astrophotonics for exoplanet detection. The non-NASA applications include spectroscopy, optical communications, medical and clinical research, quantum computing, quantum information, and quantum metrology."

        "Abstract": "Single-photon counting techniques using single-photon detectors (SPDs) are needed in a variety of emerging quantum measurement and communication applications. To meet these needs, the development of ultrasensitive, high precision quantum sensing and measurement devices (i.e. not obtainable with classical methods) will play a key role in future NASA, commercial and other government communication and analysis systems. Nanohmics, Inc. and Prof. Anton Malkorsquo;s research group at the University of Texas at Dallasnbsp;is to develop a laser-pump on-demand single-photon pair source based on biexciton cascade emission in semiconductor quantum dots for correlated calibration of SPDs. Relative to the approach of spontaneous parametric down-conversion in generating single-photon pairs, the proposed technology has advantages of on-demand photon pair generation, high efficiency, low-cost, and scalability. During Phase I, we demonstrated high biexciton cascade emission efficiency in single colloidal QDs nanocrystals and fabricated bullseye antenna to enhance photon emission of single QDs. During Phase II, we will integrate commercially availablenbsp;off-the-shelfnbsp;optics and electronics and incorporate QD-bullseye hybrid structures to construct a prototype optical system to generate single-photon pairs and demonstrate correlated calibration of SPDs."

Building on the success of Phase I efforts on modeling laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of Inconel 625 (IN625), QuesTek partnering with Northwestern University will expand their proof-of-concept tools to higher length scales and new materials. Professor Gregory Wagner, Northwestern University PI, will continue to focus on improved multiscale thermal history models to achieve higher accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. QuesTek will continue to develop their grain growth algorithm by achieving higher computational efficiency as well as higher accuracy through the increased usage of physics-informed predictions.The objective of the Phase II program is three-fold: continue to improve on the efficiency and accuracy of the proof-of-concept tools developed in Phase I, demonstrate extensibility of the tools by applying them to a new material Ti-6Al-4V (Ti64), and integrate all developed tools into a cohesive software framework. Further, model results will be validated by a robust AM study aimed at obtaining 3D grain structure data as a function of different printing parameters, strategies, and build geometries for both LPBF-processed IN625 and Ti64.QuesTek will utilize its expertise in the field of ICME to lead the overall STTR program with the objective of guiding the standardization and qualification of AM processing using an innovative tool set with improved accuracy and efficiency of as-printed predictions, linking the tool to QuesTekrsquo;s already mature post-printing processing simulations to enable complete and robust predictions of AM parts from-powder-to-part."

        "Abstract": "We are proposing Kerr-soliton On-chip Microcombs with Optimized Dispersion for Octave-spanning Output (KOMODO). The KOMODO platform will be a chip-scale optical frequency comb compatible with compact, deployable, next-generation optical atomic clocks and quantum sensors. Our proposed solution brings together engineered nano-scale waveguides, precision laser stabilization techniques, and advanced photonic packaging to realize true chip-integrated comb sources for demanding terrestrial and space-based applications in timing, spectroscopy, and quantum sensing. The project will translate directly into a commercial device that will provide a stabilized broadband frequency-comb output with low size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements.nbsp;Frequency combs are extremely stable multi-wavelength laser systems that provide a coherent link between the optical and microwave domains. Octave-spanning combs are essential for modern atomic timekeeping, where the comb is required to read out an optical atomic clock laser. The current state-of-the-art in compact frequency combs are fiber-based mode-locked lasers. While such systems have been instrumental in starting the transition of frequency combs outside of the laboratory, the SWaP requirements are still incompatible with many uses, especially space-based applications.nbsp;In contrast, microcombs offer a path towards reducing the SWaP of these systems by an order of magnitude, opening possibilities for the integration of combs into hand-held devices and low-power spacecraft. The proposed KOMODO platform represents a new paradigm for fully stabilized microresonator frequency combs with low SWaP. We will achieve this by improving the TRL of four key technologies in this program: 1) turn-key comb generation with hybrid-integrated pump lasers, 2) advanced dispersion control through engineered photonic-crystal ring resonators, 3) self-referenced microcomb stabilization, and 4) environmentally robust photonic packaging.\nnbsp;"

        "Abstract": "Atomic systems are adopted in a growing number of field-deployable sensors for time-keeping, inertial navigation, gravity sensing, magnetometry, electric-field (RF\/microwave) sensing, and others. Quantum sensing, taking advantage of the quantum mechanical behavior of neutral atoms, is expected to significantly boost the sensitivity of various sensor modalities critical in NASA and other government or commercial applications. Opto-Atomics Corp. (OAC) proposes to develop a Rugged Atomic Sensor Laser (RASL) for NASArsquo;s in-space atom-based sensing applications. RASL will offer flight-qualifiable, rugged, long-life laser systems offering narrow linewidth and high tunability. The RASL platform can be used in atom-based sensing with various atomic species of interest to NASA, even multiple species at the same time if needed, thereby serving as a flexible, versatile, compact light source addressing many NASA missions under a shared system architecture and design. In Phase I, OAC will design and assemble key system components of RASL, evaluate their performance, and perform feasibility demonstrations. We will also conduct a preliminary design of the fully-packaged, configurable RASL system for future development."

These manufacturing challenges are exacerbated by free-form optical designs that rely on difficult multi-axis sub-aperture machining or tool rastering and protracted 3-D surface characterization techniques.nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; The technical objectives in this project open the opportunity for low-cost, free-form optics manufacturing by integrating an in-situ optical metrology system into a newly-developed laser-based machining tool to achieve nanometer (x, y, z) root mean square precision over a 160 cm^2 glass workpiece. The metrology system will overcome the current challenges of characterizing free-forms with large spherical departure (gt;1mm), small inflection points, and asymmetries.nbsp; The approach of measuring optical properties, in contrast to the ndash; as usual ndash; physical shape, will also ensure the parts are functionally deployable. The overall project outcome will be a freeform optics manufacturing technology akin to the significance of CNC machining ushering in a new generation of rapid, cost-effective, and high-precision manufacturing that will be transformative to the optics industry.nbsp;"

        "Abstract": "OEwaves Inc. offers to develop and demonstrate a high-performance miniature photonic oscillator [1] suitable for delivering spectrally pure W-band signals. The device will be based on ultra-narrow line self-injection locked lasers and will operate as a local oscillator (LO) in cloud radar front end, and other high frequency systems including radio astronomy, spectroscopy, and communication systems where achieving higher performance is limited by the oscillator noise. The photonic oscillator proposed here is based on integration of an ultra-high quality (Q) crystalline whispering gallery mode (WGM) microresonator [2-4] with multiple photonic and microelectronic components and devices (including lasers, a detector, and waveguides) to produce signals with spectral purity exceeding that of conventional oscillators. nbsp;This architecture will be implemented on a single platform with micrometer-scale feature sizes. The oscillator will produce 10 mW of output RF power in W-band, and its single sideband (SSB) power spectral density of phase noise will be as low as -10 dBc\/Hz at 10 Hz and -160 dBc at 10 MHz and higher Fourier frequencies. This is at least an order of magnitude better than the state of the art for the systems of comparable size, weight and power. The primary carrier frequency to be demonstrated is 96 GHz, along with the capability to operate at any frequency in the range of 92-100 GHz. nbsp;The photonic LO can be phase locked (PL) to an external reference oscillator.nbsp;Advanced NASA applications require microwave and mm-wave frequency oscillators generating spectrally pure signals to eliminate the noise associated, for example, with compression of the received radar signals to increase the resolution. For airborne and spaceborne devices, the desired size is smaller than a quarter (25 cent coin), with power consumption significantly less than a Watt. Existing technologies cannot meet these requirements, so new and revolutionary approaches are necessary.nbsp;"

Plume-Surface-Interactions (PSI) in supersonic, highly rarefied, low gravity environments remain poorly understood. Temporally and spatially variable particle size distributions in lunar ejecta have never been measured accurately. Estimates depend heavily on assumptions and modeling, for which accurate empirical input data from landers is critically needed to predict and prevent damage. Knowledge of particle size distributions in lander plumes will be vital to the coming Gateway and Moon to Mars missions.nbsp; Hence, our instrument and method represent a Game Changing Development. The method determines laser beam propagation decay constants at multiple wavelengths from imaged light scatter. Phase I showed that various relevant distributions could be determined from knowledge of beam decay constants at as few as four wavelengths. nbsp;We will develop and test the theory and calculation methods to obtain particle size distributions from beam propagation decay, determine accuracy of the calculation results and effects of uncertainty, and develop on-board automated image and data processing.nbsp; We will perform experiments on laboratory scattering standards to confirm methods for acquiring beam propagation decay constants and transformation into particle distributions, including relevant particle sizes, mineral mixtures, spatial inhomogeneities, and dynamic particle clouds in vacuum with Lunar simulant.nbsp; System engineering will select and acquire lasers and cameras for a system prototype, design and fabricate low SWaP system packaging, and design a system mount that simulates a lander platform for lab and field tests.nbsp; Preparation for flight testing will specify a system configuration, complete a Payload Flight Request, and fabricate the system prototype for Phase II E flight tests."

RIVA has integrated launch protection for its shock amp; vibration isolation component. RIVA is directly applicable to long-range optical telecommunication systems, and it is beneficial for any sensitive instrument requiring high stability for improved performance. RIVA will reduce angular errors from vibrations reaching low mass laser beam control assemblies. While this project is focused on space version of RIVA, eventually, our solution will have two additional variants designed for a particular operating condition and platform, i.e., Ground and Air. It will meet qualifications of extreme shock and vibration attenuation during non-operating period and mitigates high frequency micro vibrations during laser operations while minimizing its weight to meet mission requirements. Our innovative solution offers low size, weight, and power (SWaP) with improved efficiency, reliability, and robustness as related to its function, high frequency isolation. RIVA will utilize our proprietary elastomeric formulas which have been space-qualified and deployed upon NASA spacecraft. The soft prototype showed a reduction of launch load acceleration to the optical device from a peak value of roughly 1500 Gs to below 7 Gs (99.5% reduction). In addition, the maximum stress induced in the soft elastomer (0.2 MPa) was well below the rupture point (ultimate tensile strength) for rubber (3-5 MPa). In other words, the soft elastomer is protected from launch loads due to the hard elastomer engaging during the launch event. Four RIVAs, supporting an optical platform, showed a reduction in angular vibration from 150 micro;radians to below 1.5 micro;radians (99% reduction or 40 dB reduction based on 20Log) over 100 Hz.nbsp;"

This creates cost and complexity, inhibits volume scaling,nbsp;and inhibits ruggedization.nbsp;nbsp;These factors havenbsp;in turn inhibited widespread commercial adoption of FOSS in avionics applications and precluded embedding this technology into commercial flight vehicles for continuous in-flight structural health monitoring.nbsp;nbsp;Praevium will endeavor to solve these problems by building on its prior work done in developing micro-electromechanical systems tunable vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (MEMS-VCSELs) for swept source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT). Although FOSS employs optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR), which is similar to SSOCT, thenbsp;much longer interferometer delays and much lower wavelength sweep rates employed in FOSS require the effects of Brownian motion on the MEMS actuatornbsp;to be mitigated.nbsp;In this work, Praevium Research will minimize the effects of Brownian motion through re-design of the MEMS actuator structure. Additionally, Praeviumnbsp;will develop a low weight and power ruggedized butterfly package based on newly emerging electrically pumped MEMS-VCSELs, eliminating costly and bulky components such as the pump laser, isolator, and wavelength division multiplexer needed in commercial optically pumped devices. Praevium will work with subcontractor Sensuron, who has expertise in FOSS to evaluate the newly developed laser. Sensuron will evaluate the Praevium MEMS-VCSEL in various interferometer configurations, and develop high speed data acquisition and computation to integrate the new laser into a fiber bragg grating based sensor measurement. Results will be compared with existing laser sources.nbsp;"

        "Abstract": "In this Phase I program, MicroLink proposes to develop a laser power converter array technology that provides a pathway for kW-level power beaming on the Lunar or Martiannbsp;surface. nbsp;NASArsquo;s planned human exploration of the lunar surface and as well as Mars will require innovative technologies to transmit high power over long distances. nbsp;The craters on the lunar poles are of particular interest as they are in permanent shadow and may harbor valuable resources such as water ice. nbsp;However, the shadowed craters present a challenge for power generation since conventional solar arrays cannot be used for energy collection on vehicles such as rovers. nbsp;Laser power beaming has been proposed as one method to power a rover directly from an energy source located at the rim of the crater, which could be a solar array or nuclear reactor (Figure 1). nbsp;In ldquo;Laser Power Beaming for Lunar Polar Explorationrdquo;, Landis notes that the recent emergence of efficient and compact fiber laser sources greatly improves the feasibility of such an approach and identifies 1064 nm as an attractive wavelength based on available fiber lasers. nbsp;Meter-scale, space-grade laser power converters will need to be developed at this wavelength that can efficiently collect 100s to 1000s of watts. nbsp;The power converters will need to be compatible with the lunar environment and in a form factor that is lightweight and can be compactly stowed. nbsp;MicroLinkrsquo;s experience in thin-film III-V semiconductor materials, solar optical devices, and space-grade blanket technologies presents a unique opportunity to develop laser power converters that are high-performance, radiation-hard, stowable and highly enabling for future lunar and Mars missions."

        "Abstract": "Despite enormous progress in metallic additive manufacturing (AM) process, one of the most notable needs is the industry agreement for the development of proper in-situ sensing methods and implementation of in-process sensors (monitoring\/controlling) for product acceptance.nbsp;nbsp;Even though the usage of different signal processing techniques has greatly improved the defect tracking-learning-detection and classification performance, seldom are these methods robust and reliable enough to meet in-space standards and customers satisfaction. In order to develop reliable NDE in-process sensing and monitoring technologies for AM processes used to produce critical components for in-space applications, smart optical monitoring system based on spectroscopy is adopted and following technical challenges will be addressed by performing; (1) Understand the mechanism on how different composition, phase transformation and manufacturing defects affect the characterization of the laser\/arc induced plasma; (2) Design effective algorithms and a seamless hardware digital signal processing unit that are able interpret the plasma signal for manufacturing quality prediction with high accuracy and reliability; and (3) Design a in-process monitoring \/ control system to adjust the manufacturing parameters to guarantee manufacturing quality.nbsp;nbsp;Thenbsp;approachnbsp;to tackle these challenges is to usenbsp;a good balance between understanding how different manufacturing defects, compositions and phase transformations affect the plasma characterization and the use of effective algorithm to interpret the change of plasma to reflect the defects.nbsp;nbsp;The successful execution of the tasks proposed will help us develop a smart sensor far beyond the available state-of-the-art technologies to provide in-situ and reliable prediction of composition, phase transformation and manufacturing defect that meets in-space application standards."

        "Abstract": "Design and fabrication of BICMOS 90 nm SiGe 9HP circuit blocks leading to pulse width modulator (PWM) for laser modulation in optical communication and binary phase shift key (BPSK) modulator for rf communication. Both modulators require stable clock for reliable cold capable operation so highly stable reference clock is designed to enable reliable modulation and signal recovery. Designs of the circuits and functional blocks (such as Op Amp, Voltage reference, comparator, varactor diode, etc.) not only have direct role in the CCM variety, they offer individual component based solution to much wider rangenbsp;of cold capable and rad hard applications. Utilization of BICMOS 90nm SiGe 9HP process and HBD techniques are quite synergistic in enabling the widest range of high performance circuit blocks for deep space robotics and other wider scope of space application platforms. Low flicker noise in SiGe-HBT makes it the preferred choice for low phase noise clocks and oscillator used in radar and demanding high bit density DSP applications and extending tonbsp;space based navigation and guidance systems. A highly valuable outcome of the investigation is to have a clear approach to clean spectrum, highly stable signal sources that offers very low phase noise and RMS jitter thus making it quite suitable for in-situ and agile DSP for robotic systems, highly precision sensors in harsh environment and software defined radio (SDR). Furthermore, in addition to being a basic rugged and rad-hard modulator, it is directly and efficiently adaptable to be used as a highly stable frequency source without the need for thermal stabilization. It directly addresses applications relying sub ppm stability with no size, weight or power penalty. An example of the application could be a local oscillator for autonomous robotic navigation and also in the signal chain that is typically used in mobile and agile radar."

        "Abstract": "We plan to develop a monolithic Q-switched Waveguide Laser, using ultrafast laser inscription (ULI) technology. The proposed prototype is enabled by a Q-switched operation of waveguide realized by ULI inside diffusion-bonded laser media. Owing to its flexibility, ease for integration, and three-dimension nature, ULI of waveguides in laser materials and dielectric media enables transformative lidar system architectures.The proposed device integrates three components through direct ULI of waveguide inside two diffusion-bonded crystals as active laser media and as saturable absorber for Q-switching. The laser cavity is ended by a dichroic dielectric coating at the input and the output sides. This architecture will result in a monolithic nanosecond pulsed laser at 1064 nm leading to a low-cost, compact, and durable solution.The waveguide structure leads to better confinement and excellent overlap between pump and laser modes over the entire length of the media. This will lead to small lasing thresholds, high slope efficiency, and high output power.The proposed device addresses NASArsquo;s wavelength of interest for aerosol detection. The prototype and its technological translation and implementation are interesting for alignment-free, low-cost, weight, and power requirement of small platforms and applications, overcoming the drawbacks of current microchip laser systems for lidars. In the future, this will lead to more robust integrated ULI-based lidar systems at other wavelengths from near-surface, airborne, and spaceborne platforms.The offeror, Aktiwave LLC, is exceptionally well aligned for the technological development and commercialization of ultrafast-laser-based fabrications. Recently, the offeror demonstrated the lowest threshold and high slope efficiency ULI waveguide-based Nd:YAG continuous-wave laser at 1064 nm."

The innovations in the use of wide FOV optics and digital micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) switching with IR focal plane array (FPA) tracking and avalanche photodiode array detection will enable a modular compact integration of the proposed system capable of scanning multiple, simultaneous laser beams for providing robust connectivity between CubeSats and\/or from CubeSats to the lunar surface. In Phase I, Intellisense will develop a viable conceptual design of M-BEAMAR that satisfies NASArsquo;s communication and navigation requirements, including SWaP-C, relative and absolute position, timing, FOV, pointing and tracking, and link power budget, demonstrate the designrsquo;s feasibility by prototyping and testing key enabling technologies, and develop a Phase II plan. In Phase II, Intellisense will develop a prototype of the M-BEAMAR system that will be integrated with a commercial off-the-shelf or government off-the-shelf FSO modem to support laboratory testing and field demonstration towards development into space-qualifiable and commercially available CubeSat communication payloads."

        "Abstract": "We propose the development of a novel laser-based gyro and accelerometer, pushing the sensitivity to the fundamental limit. The device is based on two correlated frequency combs of the same repetition rate, generated in a single laser cavity. Because of this correlation, while the bandwidth of a tooth of each comb is in the Megahertz range, the bandwidth of the interference is less than 0.1 Hertz. Dispersion control of the circulating laser pulses leads to a further increase in sensitivity of this intracavity phase interferometer.In addition to the boost in sensitivity, we will reduce the noise. The classical noise limit will be reached by classical means like a high repetition rate of the measurement and additional control loops. Applying the technique of squeezed light will then be used to approach the fundamental limit of sensitivity.The results achieved in Phase I on a discrete-components OPO will be applied to two fiber-OPO prototypes. These devices are expected to be competitive with the LIGO in terms of sensitivity."

        "Abstract": "We propose the development of a new instrumentation based on a concept for trace-gas and isotope analysis that utilizes a priority hollow fiber as a low-volume, compact gas cell. An analyte is drawn into the fiber, which has a reflective inner coating that guides a tunable laser beam to a detector. There is near unity overlap between the laser beam and the gas sample, leading to a highly sensitive system with an ultra-compact size. In Phase II, a prototype analyzer will be assembled, and measurements conducted to prove the performance of the novel instrument. The isotope analyzer will also be combined with a prototype sampling front-end to demonstrate a complete system in simulated conditions. A path towards NASA insertion for both lunar and other planetary applications will be developed. In parallel we will demonstrate the technology for commercial applications, targeting markets where the sensor can effectively fill a growing need for robust field-capable isotopic analyzers."

        "Abstract": "In this SBIR project we will develop a new compact laser-spectroscopic instrument to measure humidity in the upper troposphere under conditions favoring the formation of persistent aircraft-induced contrails and contrail-cirrus clouds. Aircraft-induced contrail-cirrus clouds account for the major share of aviationrsquo;s climate impact by way of radiative forcing. It is therefore critical to try and minimize the occurrence of contrails and contrail cirrus to reduce the climate impact of the global aviation fleet.nbsp;Our system will make active contrail-cirrus avoidance possible by the real-time measurement of the humidity state of the atmosphere and hence allow for active cirrus-contrail mitigation strategies.nbsp;The system we propose will measure atmospheric humidity using laser spectroscopy and will provide a better detection limit than presently available commercial technology. It will have low-power consumption, and will be compact enough to be a permanent asset including data downlink on commercial aircraft for continuous humidity monitoring at cruise altitude as well as during the ascent\/descent profiles. To minimize the climate impact of global aviation we need aircraft equipped with our technology that fly on intercontinental routes along the busiest flight corridors."

We propose to develop a novel approach to Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) for detecting human pathogens in seafood reared and harvested from aquaculture farms, at point-of-sale in seafood markets, and in the environment. Our approach uses a higher energy laser wavelength (422 and 532nm) compared with the lower energy of more the commonly used laser at 785nm, a novel mixture and preparation of Ag-coated Nano Particles (AgNPs), a fiber optic probe that may be used directly on seafood tissue and environmental samples, and the use of barcoding the Raman spectra with Deep Learning classification through a Convolutional Deep Learning Neural Network (CDLNN). Taken together, the novel microfluidic instrument will allow hand held or in situ identification and quantification of pathogen species and their dominant strains. Real-time detection of E. coli and other fecal coliforms from buoys or the end of docks would allow for immediate mapping of contamination source and early response by environmental managers."

        "Abstract": "Field Data Services (FDS) proposes a technical feasibility study of newly available solid state LiDAR\nsensor chips for detecting migrating anadromous fish in small spawning streams. The LiDAR chip, first\nintroduced in October 2020, uses an invisible infrared laser to measure time-of-flight distances to nearby objects with millimeter accuracy. This tiny computer chip is breakthrough technology that could enable low-cost detection of salmonids as they move over shallow riffles in small and currently unmonitored spawning streams. FDS will build an automated test system for acquiring statistically valid data that characterizes the LiDAR\u2019s ability to detect salmonids as they move across a controlled flow tank. The experiments will be designed to define the range of streamflow, depth, weather, lighting and moving target characteristics that can be reliably detected by an array of LiDAR chips. These tests will determine the commercial feasibility of a small, portable and easily-deployed device that can be placed above shallow streams for counting migrating salmonids. The LiDAR sensor chips will be incorporated into an existing field-proven digital platform that includes an AI-enabled smart camera and long-distance wireless link. Such a device would enable small organizations and citizen scientists to fill data gaps for numerous salmonid spawning streams."

        "Abstract": "The most lethal of all laser-aided systems, the beamrider missile is a family of weapons designed to use a laser to steer a projectile onto an enemy platform. The difficulty in employing near-field obscurants to defeat LBMs is that once the missile has reached the obscuring field it has already been well-guided and for all intents and purposes can be considered \u201con-target\u201d at the point when the onboard forward-looking guidance systems take over. This means that the probability a hit or near-hit remains high. An obscurant capable of rapidly being deployed at hypersonic speeds and at kilometer ranges along the designated Beamriding-Vector (BV) would scatter and disrupt the columnated targeting signal causing the guidance system of the now unattended missile to hunt for the beamrider signal and wander off target causing a miss. Deploying obscurants at hypersonic velocities faces a number of challenges; specifically, the compression (bow shock) and recompression (tail shock) sweep any released particulate into the munition\u2019s turbulent wake where they aggregate. The Momentum-Arrest &amp; Shock Collapse LBM countermeasure utilizes an onboard Explosive Impulse Brake to near-instantaneously halt the munition thereby causing shock collapse and allowing for wide area dissemination of obscurants through launchable submunitions."

        "Abstract": "For effective protection against radiated threats, produced by high altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) caused by nuclear detonations and high-power microwave (HPM) Directed Energy (DE) weapons it is important to understand not only the physics of the threats, but also to quantify the effects on mission-critical electrical systems. EMP\/HMP simulators enable threat level testing of MCS and provide stakeholders valuable quantitative information pertaining to such threats so that engineering principals, risk mitigation designs\/protocols, and countermeasures can be implemented. The protection of MCS is necessary to ensure the integrity and survivability of government and economic assets from HEMP and HMP events. HEMP vulnerability and susceptibility testing requires the delivery of high peak power and high peak electric fields to targets. The most practical solution to simulate such environments on mission -critical systems is to develop a modular, portable, optically isolated MV-antenna array. This proposal presents an inexpensive 100 kV Pulse Charger and a low-jitter Laser Trigger System capable of simultaneously driving many gallium arsenide (GaAs) photoconductive semiconductor switches (PCSS) to drive largescale antenna arrays with 1500 mJ and spread over about 3 cm2 (500 mJ\/cm2) and provides prompt triggering with peak power exceeding 100 kW. The primarily focus of the proposed effort will be on designing an improved and novel antenna radiator which minimizes impedance mismatches, demonstrating the 3x3 array to be a viable E1 EMP simulator test option, comparing acquired electric field data to openly available published data on existing E1 standards, and electric field characterization of the improved single horn antenna and array."

Laser-based ranging techniques offer the potential of high resolution and high speed. However, the challenging underwater environments could limit the performance of the optical ranging system. Specifically, (a) dynamic scattering particles distorts the optical beam in both time and space which limits ranging resolution and the maximum ranging distance, and (b) turbulence further distorts the wavefront of the optical beam and thus affects the ranging resolution. R-DEX Systems (R-DEX) proposes to team with its strategic partner to develop a structured-light-based high-resolution and high-dynamic-range optical ranging system.

        "Abstract": "During this Phase II program, a non-invasive refrigerant (R134a) sensor capable of measuring the real-time quality of a two-phase flow will be developed. This sensor is designed for maximum ruggedness while achieving high measurement repeatability across different flow regimes, dynamic motion events, and orientations. The ultimate aim is an inexpensive sensor, which can be easily deployed to provide fluid quality measurements as a control for high-powered pumped two-phase (P2P) electronics cooling systems used by the Navy. Advanced Cooling Technologies (ACT) will develop a new sensor capable of simultaneously resolving the quality and void fraction of a two-phase refrigerant flow and reporting these quantities as a simple milli-amp signal. The sensor features a flow-through design for minimum flow disturbance and is built using a solid-state architecture, preventing sensor damage and measurement uncertainties during dynamic motion. Lockheed Martin (LM) will serve as a subcontractor on this project with their experience with P2P systems for directed energy laser weapons systems serving as a benchmark for the development of the sensor. By the end of the Phase II program, a production prototype sensor will be tested that can accurately measure fluid qualities between 0 and 1, reliably operate in an environment subject to high vibration and shock events, and meet the weight ("

        "Abstract": "There is a growing need to develop inexpensive, lightweight mid\/long-wave infrared (M\/LWIR) devices for applications including gas sensing, point-to-point free-space communication, and bio sensing. Most of these applications require well-collimated, spectrally narrow beams which are currently achieved using MWIR laser sources. However, these lasers are expensive and bulky, which limits their use in size, weight, and power-constrained (SWAP) devices. Light emitting diodes (LEDs) offer a solution for lightweight, low-cost, and low-power MWIR sources. However, the traditional LED optical packaging, which is developed for visible wavelengths, is opaque in the M\/LWIR. In this work, we will develop metasurface-based optics (meta-optics) for beamforming and filtering single and multiple MWIR LED emission bands. Meta-optics use subwavelength elements to impart local phase shifts and can achieve functionalities beyond that of refractive optics. We will use inverse design methods to develop the meta-optic architecture and will employ CMOS-compatible fabrication processes so the devices can be readily manufactured. We will work closely with a leading vendor of optical devices to ensure our meta-optic window will fit their commercial LED packaging solutions. Success in this effort will expand military mission capability by enabling a new generation of wearable, UAV, and space-based devices.\u00a0"

        "Abstract": "Pier assets and wharf infrastructure have a critical role in the US Naval strategies and mission capabilities. Expeditionary inspections, assessments, and repair planning requires trained operators, engineers, and a prohibitive number of man hours. The US Navy currently collects three-dimensional (3D) point cloud data on the structures using subsea acoustic multibeam systems (MBES) and terrestrial laser scanning (LIDAR) from manned surface vessels. The 3D data provides a rich point cloud defining the shape and bulk conditions of the structures. Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) models provides a new opportunity to leverage these data for an automated pier battle damage assessment tool, significantly reducing the time required to assess and make volumetric repair estimates.\u00a0 \u00a0Makai proposes an offline expeditionary post-processing tool that uses the strength of neural networks to identify and segment point cloud data into known components of the pier and wharves, and state of the art shape-fitting algorithms to automatically generate \u201clike-new\u201d reconstructions, and then estimate statistical deformations and gaps between the point clouds and reconstructions; providing tabulated and graphical analysis of pier\/wharf damage and repair requirements. Critical software modules include data processing, neural network classification, data clustering, primitive shape fitting, deformation and damage analysis, and graphical user interfaces and tabular data outputs. The proposed approach provides an achievable solution to this problem, focusing on systems that can work off the network, are well suited for future commercialization, provide computational efficiency, and perform robustly through proper training of the ML algorithms and strategic use augmented reality GUI design."

        "Abstract": "Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and imaging systems offer unique functionalities for material characterization, non-destructive quality control (QC), chemical detection, and biomedical imaging. However, practical utilization of these systems for solving real-world problems has been limited because of the absence of high-performance, multi-pixel terahertz detectors that can offer both high data quality and fast data acquisition over a broad frequency range. Existing THz-TDS systems consist of single pixel detectors and require two-dimensional scanning of either the scanned object or the detector, which is not practical for many potential applications of these systems. Developing a broadband terahertz focal plane array (THz-FPA) can address this problem; however, realization of a THz-FPA for THz-TDS systems has not been possible yet due to the design restrictions of conventional photoconductive terahertz detectors. The plasmonic nanoantenna technology developed by the co-founders of Lookin, Inc. provides a unique solution for developing THz-FPAs. As proved by feasibility tests during the Phase I program, terahertz detectors based on plasmonic nanoantennas offer record-high sensitivity levels and, through their scalable architecture, they can be fabricated over large areas without introducing bandwidth-limiting parasitics. Encouraged by the results of the Phase I program, during which a 64-pixel THz-FPA prototype was successfully developed, Lookin, Inc. intends to further extend this advanced terahertz detector technology during the Phase II Base program to develop THz-FPAs consisting of 256\u00d7256 pixels. The THz-FPAs will be designed to offer large field-of-view (FOV) and image acquisition rates up to 10 Hz. In addition to the THz-FPA development, Lookin, Inc. plans to build a multi-pixel terahertz imaging platform through a custom-made compact, fiber-coupled, and high-power femtosecond laser. The team also plans to design various terahertz lenses to offer different functionalities, such as adjustable FOV and line scanning with the THz-FPA and multi-pixel imaging system. After the development of the proposed large-pixel-count THz-FPAs and high-speed terahertz imaging systems, Lookin, Inc. plans to use the multi-pixel terahertz imaging systems as a transformative solution for a currently unmet need in lithium-ion battery (LIB) manufacturing, in-line QC of LIB electrodes. In-line QC of LIB electrodes can improve manufacturing capability to deliver high power batteries with better shelf life, increased safety, lower cost, and decreased production lead-time. During the Phase II Option program, Lookin, Inc. plans to modify the high-speed terahertz imaging systems to be installed in LIB manufacturing facilities for high throughput scanning of LIB electrodes and conduct extensive validation studies in collaboration with battery manufacturers."

        "Abstract": "Multispectral imaging is gaining increasing interest in the defense world, due to its potential ability to reduce weight, size and power consumption of optical systems, while still maintaining the ability to capture images in multiple spectral bands. At the same time, the use of high-power, high-energy lasers is also increasing, most often in conjunction with an imaging system for targeting and data collection. The Overall Goal of this Phase I Research Proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of producing an optical quality glass which can meet all of the demands outlined above for multispectral imaging applications. The specific requirements include the development of a chalcogenide glass window with a laser damage threshold of 1 MW\/cm2 over the range of 1.030 to 1.070 \u00b5m, zero or near zero thermo-optic coefficient, especially at 1.064 \u00b5m, low absorption coefficient, &lt; 0.05\/cm especially at 1.064 \u00b5m, optical transmission &gt;63.5% in the MWIR and LWIR regions, ideally out to 14 \u00b5m, and durability over a range of environmental conditions, including light exposure during storage, operating temperatures from -40\u00b0C to +71\u00b0C with humidity up to 95%, and storage and thermal shock from -51\u00b0C to +71\u00b0C."

        "Abstract": "Stratonics has proposed a plan to develop technology for thermal control of DED processing to achieve uniform and consistent material quality. Thermal control will be applied on both the micro and macro scale, enabling stable deposition of melt pool solidification and associated initial microstructure on the spatial scale of the melt pool size, and enabling stable cooling from initial material states immediately following the melt pool to much cooler states where the microstructure has become stable. On the microscale, the laser heats both the prior layer and new powder delivered by the machine to form the melt pool, hence a rapid heating cycle which is immediately followed by a rapid cooling cycle. As the melt pool cools and solidifies, the initial microstructure is set. The newly formed microstructure and its microstructure transition thru repeated cooling cycles as more and more layers are applied. As the material is cooling its microstructure continues to migrate towards its equilibrium or final condition. Temperature sensors and process controls are developed to control this process for repeated thermal trajectories; hence the control system directs the final microstructure and material performance in a uniform and consistent manner. Such a thermal controlled DED process will provide for parts with uniform materials properties and with consistency with production volumes of AM parts."

The objective is to to produce higher performing weapon mounted laser ranging\/aiming\/pointing\/illuminating prototypes with reduced size &amp; weight, increased durability, capable of being used on United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) small arms weapon platforms. This fills the gap that exists with currently fielded squad weapon mounted lasers with inadequate power and ranging capabilities, while being achieved in a compact size package. The methods employed will be the integration of existing and emerging technologies through system trade analysis selection for the various subcomponents\/technologies. Special attention will be given to operator inputs as it relates to ergonomic preferences. By leveraging Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 8-9 component technologies, there is a high confidence of success and relatively low risk. A summary of results shows our reduced size and weight weapon mounted laser rangefinders exceed range requirements. Further , extensive experience with the integration of Near infrared Illumination VCSEL technology produces reduced beam and speckle as well as high beam uniformity to achieve operator capability to illuminate and detect humans from 0-900 meters. In conclusion, Wilcox is well positioned to execute against the SBIR MARL topic requirements and produce the requisite prototypes in a timely manner. Further, based on our company&apos;s facilities, equipment and personnel, we have a track record of success for transitioning such systems from development to product for full commercialization."

Success of these techniques will streamline the supply chain, reduce the cost and optimize the use of Nanocrystalline properties of the core for reduced losses, increased power density and operation above 150?C.\nExploiting the incredible cooling rates of AM (106-107 \u00b0C\/sec) available at BU\u2019s Powder bed metal selective laser melting printer (EOS m290), HF nanocrystalline magnetic material conforming to the geometry shown in Fig. 1 can be printed using AM.1 Through engineered spatial cooling gradients, the formation of lower electrical conductivity dendrites can be controlled, for lowering the electrical conductivity in the direction in which eddy currents form inside the magnetic core thus reducing eddy current losses relative to conventional ribbon form of this material at HF operation (=100 kHz).\nAlso, critical to this effort, BU\u2019s AM research group has developed a printing process to print metals onto silicon and dielectrics, which will be adapted to print directly onto fiber glass reinforced FR4 PCBs for DABC and to bond dielectric airgaps.2\u20134 This can be achieved by using a low-melting point alloy that reactively bonds to the FR4 and most metals."

        "Abstract": "Characterization of hypersonic flow in a large-scale ground test facility is challenging due to the extreme thermodynamic and fluid dynamic environment, which exhibits drastic spatio-temporal variations. Physical probes can be inserted into the flow, but point data is insufficient and the probe will invariably alter the flow field, potentially affecting the quantities of interest by changing the flow pattern, quenching key reactions, or acting as a catalyst. Optical diagnostics are non-intrusive, but existing techniques cannot provide robust velocity data in a high enthalpy flow, let alone surrogate parameters like temperature, species, and pressure. Therefore, there is a need for diagnostics that can measure these thermo-fluid properties over the wide field-of-view typical of large-scale supersonic and hypersonic applications. ISSI proposes to address this need using Linear Absorption Tomography with Velocimetry (LATV). LATV is based on laser absorption spectroscopy, a molecular diagnostic that is directly sensitive to the absorbance of a target fluid along the measurement path. The diagnostic utilizes a network of laser beams and tomographic reconstruction algorithm to produce 2D measurements of velocity, temperature, species, and pressure in a tilted plane. This diagnostic has been demonstrated for internal supersonic reacting flows as well as jet plumes. Our implementation is unique in that it utilizes Bayesian physics-informed neural networks to conduct data assimilation with built in uncertainty quantification. Use of the LATV technique at hypersonic flight conditions requires application-specific considerations, which will be explored in the Phase I effort. Quantifying spatio-temporally resolved exit conditions in NASArsquo;s 8 ft. hypersonic tunnel using this technique is a long-term goal of the Phase II program. Accuracy and precision will be assessed by comparing LATV measurements to conventional probe data in a controlled setting."

        "Abstract": "Oxford Defense North Carolina, LLC (ODNC) and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) will collaborate to develop a beam control metamaterial surface in this Phase I STTR effort. A concern with laser\u00a0beamed energy systems is the inadvertent exposure of operators and bystanders to inadvertently scattered or reflected laser energy. In an energy web system, multiple transmitters and receivers will be mounted on mobile land and airborne platforms, thus unexpected vehicle dynamics may cause beam misalignment and exposure of personnel from energy by reflection from adjacent structures or glint. A solution may be to cover adjacent structures with an absorptive or scattering coating, i.e. black and white paint. However, this would present a large static visual signature, and could not protect canopies or windows. Instead, we propose the development of a conformal beam control metamaterial. Metamaterials are engineered sub-wavelength periodic structures with tailored electromagnetic properties.\u00a0The metamaterial will scatter or absorb\u00a0(as designed) laser energy in a narrow band while presenting a minimal visual and infrared signature at other wavelengths. Using metamaterial theory and techniques developed in academic research, the metamaterial will be able to sustain high laser intensities without damage,\u00a0and will be able to be economically fabricated over large areas. The system is completely passive with zero reaction time, yielding a significant size, weight, power, and cost benefit over active sensing."

        "Abstract": "High-Energy Laser (HEL) systems are widely used in material processing and are increasingly important for next-generation weaponry. Current HEL technologies including fiber lasers, solid-state lasers, and spectral-beam-combined diode lasers are limited by excessive size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) or by low beam quality. A promising alternative approach is to coherently combine beams from an array of semiconductor diode lasers. Semiconductor lasers have the highest electrical-to-optical (EO) efficiency of all laser types, and are compact, rugged, inexpensive, and available at a wide range of wavelengths. Unfortunately, diode lasers are plagued by either limited output power (single emitters) or low beam quality (diode bars). Coherent beam combination promises to resolve this dilemma by scaling up the desirable properties of low-power diode lasers \u2013 high EO efficiency, compactness, and high beam quality \u2013 up to the kW level. In the Phase I SBIR Effort, EOSPACE designed an architecture for a high-power, direct-diode, coherently-combined laser system. This laser system will reach tens of kW of output power while delivering improved SWaP compared to current HEL technologies. Tapered amplifiers will be used to maintain high beam quality throughout the system, improving the final output as well as maximizing coherent combining efficiency.\u00a0 A compact, chip-based design will reduce system footprint and improve stability. The phase feedback control system will leverage lessons learned from decades of previous research in this field as well as EOSPACE\u2019s practical experience in optical phase control. To improve the manufacturability and commercial viability of the proposed high-energy laser, EOSPACE\u2019s design uses off-the-shelf components in a design planned for straightforward assembly. In Phase II we plan to build a prototype that will demonstrate every essential feature of the full-scale system. We will also carefully study the various tradeoffs in system design and performance on different metrics, paving the way for a coherently combined 60 kW diode laser system. Because EOSPACE performs nanofabrication, packaging, and RF\/optical testing in-house, we will be able to rapidly iterate and improve the design multiple times during the prototype phase. During this Phase II effort we will be able to build a scaled-down version of the high-energy laser system and explore different approaches to beam combining and phase feedback, and optimize the architecture to meet the program\u2019s goals. This Phase II SBIR effort will result in a demonstration of the high EO efficiency and beam quality of a diode-based coherently-combined laser system capable of reaching extreme output power for demanding applications in defense and manufacturing."

        "Abstract": "1 This Phase II project aims to develop and commercialize Fluorescence Enhanced Photothermal Infrared (FE-PTIR) imaging2 and spectroscopy. The proposed FE-PTIR will use fluorescence microscopy to map the distribution of fluorescently labeled3 regions of cells and tissue and then provide chemical structural analysis of the labeled regions using photothermal infrared4 spectroscopy. Fluorescence microscopy is a cornerstone technique in biological research, allowing sensitive mapping of5 specifically targeted biomolecules within cells and tissue, but it does not provide information about their molecular6 structure. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy can provide rich analysis of molecular structure and has been used in life sciences7 research to study tissue classification, drug\/tissue interaction, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and other areas.8 Conventional IR spectroscopy, however, has a fundamental spatial resolution limit (i.e. roughly how small an object it can9 analyze) of around 10 micrometers, similar to the size of an average biological cell. Thus conventional IR spectroscopy has\n10 been extremely limited for many biomedical applications where the structures of interest are smaller than a cell.\n11 The FE-PTIR technique illuminates a fluorescently labeled sample with UV\/visible light which results in fluorescent\n12 emission from fluorescently tagged molecules in the sample. A tunable infrared laser source also illuminates the sample,\n13 causing localized heating in the sample if the IR laser is tuned to a wavelength that excites molecular vibrations in the\n14 sample. Using a camera or other sensitive photodetector is used to record the fluorescent emission from different regions\n15 of the sample generates a map of the distribution of fluorescently labeled biomolecules. A key innovation of this proposal\n16 was the recognition that common fluorophores have an emission efficiency that is highly temperature dependent. Thus\n17 when the sample is also irradiated with infrared light at wavelengths corresponding to molecular vibrations, localized\n18 heating from IR absorption by the sample causes a significant change in the fluorescent emission. Recording the emission\n19 change as a function of sample position or IR wavelength produces IR absorption images and IR absorption spectra,\n20 respectively. Phase I research demonstrated the following key advances: (1) ability of FE-PTIR to map of target\n21 biomolecules with fluorescence and analyze the molecular structural of the target molecules; (2) achieve submicron\n22 spatial resolution for both fluorescence imaging and infrared spectroscopy; (3) demonstrated a 100X improvement in\n23 measurement sensitivity; (4) application of FE-PTIR to study of protein misfolding relevant to neurodegenerative disease\n24 research; (5) demonstrated FE-PTIR on individual bacterial and live cancer cells with subcellular resolution. This project is\n25 well aligned with NIH goals as it incorporates several key thrusts of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and\n26 Bioengineering, including optical imaging and spectroscopy, IR imaging, confocal microscopy, and multimodal imaging. FE-\n27 PTIR will be extremely useful for example in analyzing the molecular structure\/folding\/aggregation of fluorescence-\n28 localized proteins. Protein misfolding\/aggregation is a root cause of many neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer\u2019s).\n29 Completion of this Phase II project will lead to the commercialization of a new multimodal microscope that will offer\n30 profound benefits for biomedical research including neurodegenerative diseases and antimicrobial resistance research."

Essentium has a proven track record of disrupting the polymer additive manufacturing space with both machine and material innovations that unlock speed, strength and scale for industrial applications. Our team will replicate the material extrusion additive manufacturing ecosystem we have created with the HSE for metals by integrating a high speed microwire laser directed energy deposition (DED) head onto our closed-loop linear servo motor motion platform. We will demonstrate the value of net shape and near-net shape parts that are useful directly off the print bed with either zero or minimal post-processing required to provide value to Air Force customers. Additionally, we will show the advantage of a microwire DED printer for basic repair operations in a scan-to-print workflow. To minimize development risks and timeline for integration, Essentium has established partnerships with premier research institutions and commercial vendors who can manufacture the wire laser deposition head, laser source, and microwire feedstock to our specifications.

Ultrasound is an imaging tool which can help the medic to assess the wounds of the soldier and direct urgent evacuation and prioritize care.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ultrasound imaging advantages include that it is non-invasive, employs no radiation or contrast agents, and is inexpensive.\u00a0 Modern electronics enable the creation of small systems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, ultrasound limitations include required contact between probe and patient, the use of gel to serve as a coupling agent, and the skill level of the provider and variability in probe placement.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Laser Ultrasound (LUS) addresses these limitations. LUS employs a completely different signal generation and detection technology, with advantages for the battlefield and other clinical uses. LUS uses only light, transmitted through air, to both generate and detect acoustic vibrations in the body.\u00a0\u00a0It only needs to be moved above the patient, with no connecting medium required, no physical contact. This is advantageous in cases where skin contact is prohibited due to burns or blast debris wounds. In LUS, we restrict optical to acoustic conversion to the tissue surface and solely interrogate underlying tissue with sound.\u00a0We demonstrated the first fully eye- and skin-safe non-contact US imaging technique, enabled by laser generation and detection of sound. LUS is a groundbreaking addition to the arsenal of tools available to the medic, radiologist, surgeon, and general clinician, and enables new uses for ultrasound while addressing current ultrasound limitations. We propose to fabricate and test a series handheld, portable, LUS scanning devices \u2013 hardware and software subsystems, interfaces, and integrated system.\u00a0\u00a0We combine our commercialization experience, foundational work and detailed understanding of the LUS technology required, and work to translate LUS from our lab to the battlefield, to the field hospital, and to general clinical use.\u00a0\u00a0 We propose to 1) prototype integrated optical and electronics hardware and software components and subsystems, that are the unique to LUS; 2) prototype the front-end interface and back-end data acquisition electronics and image\u00a0reconstruction\u00a0pipeline for LUS - similar to conventional US, but with some critical differences; 3)\u00a0\u00a0test and evaluate prototypes of techniques for image acquisition and image reconstruction; 4) test and validate fully integrated compact design.\u00a0\u00a0"

        "Abstract": "The overall objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the superior performance of metasurface-coupled avalanche photodiodes (M-APDs) over incumbent APDs without metasurfaces. The M-APDs represent a new strategy to achieve high-performance APDs and would allow a precise and reliably characterization of optical quantum states via homodyne detection. To achieve this objective, we will in Phase I demonstrate the high absorption (&gt;90%) of 1550 nm light within a 100 nm-thick InGaAs layer on a low index substrate in a typical APD structure by coupling an appropriately designed metasurface. We will in Phase II fabricate the design optimized in Phase I and demonstrate M-APD operation with about two orders-of-magnitude reduction in dark current as compared to a state-of-the-art APD.\nPhase I objective and approach\nWe propose a 12-month Phase I program to demonstrate that with a suitable metasurface, a 100 nm thick InGaAs layer can absorb the same amount of 1550 nm light as a micron-thick conventional InGaAs layer, which is the key to achieving M-APDs. We will use a synergetic modeling method that combines accurate finite-element simulations of metasurfaces, realistic Monte-Carlo simulations of carrier scattering, impact ionization and diffusion, and efficient mesoscopic device modeling to design suitable metasurfaces. We will take advantage of our extensive experience in infrared device fabrication and characterization to attain the designed metasurfaces and analyze their beneficial effect on optical absorption.\nCommercial applications and other benefits\nA successful demonstration of M-APDs with high quantum efficiency, large bandwidth, and low noise would have an immediate impact to the field of quantum information. The M-APDs can be used to achieve high-fidelity optical homodyne tomography. Our approach also represents a new strategy of improving APD\u2019s performance and will undoubtedly inspire new designs of M-APDs and boost their applications in quantum processing and 3-D laser ranging LIDAR."

        "Abstract": "This project seeks to build on a Phase 1 effort to reduce the cost and supply barriers to the implementation of Al-Ce alloys in defense and commercial applications using direct reduction of cerium precursors in molten aluminum. A successful project will eliminate the need for foreign sources of cerium metal and exploit the cost differences between pure cerium and its oxide, currently a factor of three. Al-Ce alloys have good mechanical properties at high temperatures and are easy to cast-good fluidity and no hot tearing through the later stages of freezing. In alloy systems that use cerium in combination with common aluminum alloying elements such as silicon, magnesium and\/or copper, the casting characteristics are generally better than the aluminum-copper system. In the Al-Mg-Ce, Al-Zn-Ce and Al-Mg-Zn-Ce systems the alloys do not require a post casting heat treatment to develop properties because of the combined effects of dispersion strengthening by the Al-Ce intermetallic and solid solution strengthening by the magnesium and or zinc. A new class of Al-Ce alloys is being investigated that gain additional strengthening through post casting heat treatment. These alloys contain other alloying elements such as Ni, Mn and Si that improve room temperature strength and may offer advantages at elevated temperatures such as reduced coefficients of thermal expansion. In our Phase 1 effort we learned that the success of conversion of cerium precursors is dependent on the dwell time of those precursors in the melt as controlled by the mixing RPM and delay between the additions and the degassing and melt cleaning procedures. We attempted to use production de-gassing equipment for this work. That equipment is incapable of sufficient RPM to ensure good mixing and is designed for concurrent mixing along with alloy de-gassing and cleaning. In Phase 2 we propose to use specially designed equipment to do a two-stage treatment. In stage one we will do vortex mixing based on mixing speeds roughly determined in the Phase 1 program as modified based on the actual equipment mechanics, followed immediately by a degassing-cleaning stage with reduced RPM\u2019s and the use of cleaning gasses. The alloy produced will be used to produce castings and test pieces for internal and external testing. We will optimize mixing time, RPM and determine best gasses to be used in the degassing\/cleaning stage. We will characterize the alloy and compare with alloy produced using metallic cerium additions. Other alloying additions will be done pre and post cerium additions to determine relative efficiency of the cerium conversion in the presence of anticipated final alloy compositions as determined by us and our customers. The alloy will be tested in both casting form as well as in atomized powder for selective laser sintering and consolidated powder."

        "Abstract": "The problem being addressed: The plasmas generated by intense lasers are of great interest for fundamental physics and for practical reasons that include the generation of high energy photon and particle beams, industrial processes such as extreme ultraviolet lithography, and fusion energy. These plasmas have complex dynamics, of which time resolved velocity distribution can reveal important attributes, including the initial inward motion of the plasma driven by the intense laser pulse, the lateral transport of energy, and the subsequent plasma expansion. Several types of instruments have been developed to measure the plasma velocity. One of these instruments is the VISAR (velocity interferometer system for any reflector). However, as its time resolution is typically limited from nanoseconds to tens of picoseconds depending on the detectors used, it is challenging to map the velocity in the transverse direction with high temporal resolution.\nHow we propose to address the problem\/ situation in Phase I: XUV Lasers, in collaboration with Colorado State University, proposes to develop and demonstrate an instrument that will be able to map the velocity of plasmas generated by ultra-intense ultrashort pulse laser in two dimensions (2-D) with a spatial resolution of a few micrometers and femtosecond time resolution using a single spectrometer. In this instrument the Doppler shift of a second harmonic probe laser pulse of ~ 50 fs femtosecond duration reflected by the plasma will be measured simultaneously at many plasma locations using a high magnification microscope objective and a custom designed grating spectrometer. The time evolution of the velocity will be measured by varying the delay between the laser pulse that drives the plasma and the probe pulse. The necessary software to acquire, display, and convert the data into a velocity map will be developed. The instrument will be designed in Phase I and a proof-of-principle experiment will be conducted to demonstrate the concept.\nCommercial applications and other benefits: This new plasma diagnostics instrument could be of significant use in many ultra-intense laser-matter interaction experiments conducted at different research and laser facilities, including those that are part of LaserNetUS, and for the laser-created plasmas that are of industrial interest for extreme ultraviolet lithography."

        "Abstract": "The problem\/situation that is being addressed concerns the development of ultrafast coatings that will meet the specifications of the DoE solicitation: \u201cbroad-bandwidth, laser damage threshold of 0.5 J\/cm2 (1 ps), engineered using a process that is scalable to large areas.\u201d\nA major bottleneck in achieving prolonged reliable operation of ultra-high intensity lasers at high repetition rate is the failure of optical component in the laser chain, especially during and post-compression stages. Among the optical components, the weakest link has been identified to be pulse compression gratings, and to a lesser extent, high reflector mirrors and antireflection coatings exposed to the highest intensities.\nHow we propose to address the problem\/ situation: In Phase I and II of our project, a comprehensive computational infrastructure was built that incorporates proper Keldysh field ionization, collision, plasma, and propagation effects to create a dynamic 2D finite difference time domain (FDTD), and into a 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) framework model that reliably allows us to simulate high intensity laser interaction with multi-layer dielectric (MLD) systems. Using this comprehensive computational infrastructure, the proposed Phase IIA will have two main focuses: (1) the development of multilayer dielectric (MLD) high reflector and antireflection interference coatings for high repetition rate multi-tera-Watt and peta-Watt class lasers; and (2) the development of MLD gratings with optimized efficiency, bandwidth and high laser damage threshold for the most promising 1 ?m and 2 ?m platforms for a Type II laser. Novel high bandgap material mixtures and coatings\u2019 geometries will be designed and fabricated, laser damage tested and characterized ex situ to identify failure mechanisms and to implement strategies to mitigate them.\nCommercial applications and other benefits. Interference coatings demonstrate a solid performance for low-fluence narrow-bandwidth lasers but fail dramatically when tested with ultrashort pulses and at high repetition rate. This challenge coupled with a scarce supplier market open enticing commercial opportunities. Ultrafast coatings with superior laser damage performance will advance the engineering of high average and peak power femtosecond lasers for next-generation accelerator-type applications. If realized, they can create a $50 million\/year, high power-million to billion shot optics market for laser-based accelerators in scientific and medical markets."

        "Abstract": "Additive manufacturing, such as laser sintering or melting of additive layers can produce parts rapidly at small volume and in a factory setting. To make the parts nuclear quality, a real-time non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique is required to detect defects while they are being manufactured. The proposed NDE technique is a feasibility study of an optical sensor unit that is incorporated in a direct laser sintering machine to capture defects in real-time. The sensor data can be used to identify defects as they occur such that immediate corrective action can be taken. It also provides parameters that enable the prediction if the part is of nuclear quality. The proposed work is a multi-parameter sensing approach, incorporating multiple optical sensing and imaging techniques. The apparatus will be incorporated in a 3D metal printing machine. The final outputs of the sensors will be combined to produce a defect map in real-time as the part is being printed. Defects such as voids improper melting, bulging of the metal, and out-of-spec prints will be revealed. During Phase II, a prototype unit was developed for detecting defects during 3D printing of metal parts. Samples with representative defects that occur during additive manufacturing of metal parts were tested. During Phase IIA an automated machine-agnostic prototype will be fabricated and tested that outputs part quality in real-time. Defect parameters will be extracted from the data and compared to actual defect values via a series of post-fabrication tests, and accurate prediction of defect parameters will be demonstrated. When this NDE technology is commercialized, the sensor unit will be incorporated in 3D printing machines without requiring design changes to themachine. The unit will detect printing defects in real-time. The sensor data will be utilized to pre-qualify parts for nuclear quality, and therefore minimize or eliminate the need for post fabrication testing. The economic benefits include reduction of cost of post-process testing, and significant reduction of loss of labor and material due to faulty parts. DOE and other branches of the government will benefit by streamlining the nuclear parts manufacturing. The reduced cost of manufacturing will help transition to modern nuclear energy, which will benefit the public by providing safe and cost effective energy solution. Other applications include NDE for manufacturing parts for the aerospace industry."

        "Abstract": "The goal of this program is to demonstrate the fabrication of cubic-centimeter-scale permanently sealed and evacuated fused silica enclosures containing linear Paul traps for trapped-ion-related applications, such as quantum computing. The proposed miniature, highly optically-accessible enclosures will be attached to a small pumping system, or be equipped with an internal cryosorption pump capable of maintaining ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) over prolonged periods. Since the vacuum chamber itself is made from fused silica, the proposed sealed UHV enclosure will be highly flexible in terms of integrating high optical quality sections to allow access for beams and fluorescence collection, and it will be compatible with a broad range of ion trap chip designs, including 2D and 3D traps. Several leading research institutions have shown that arrays of trapped ions offer unique capabilities for quantum information processing and quantum sensing, particularly at the fidelity frontier. However, the number of ions that can be co-trapped in a given trap while still retaining this high performance is limited, and it has been expected for some time that multiple traps linked by photonic interconnects will be required to scale the system even at the level of thousands of qubits. The heart of many of these experiments, the ion trap itself, has been translated to microfabricated platforms. However, broad utilization of ion traps is presently limited by the complexity of equipment needed to manipulate the ions and maintain a favorable operating environment, such as the bulky vacuum enclosure itself and the light conditioning and delivery systems. Among other specific technologies necessary to facilitate the effective implementation of gate-based quantum computing methods on intermediate scale quantum processors, there is a need to develop a UHV-compatible bonding technology that provides for the fabrication of miniaturized, completely sealed, non-magnetic enclosures equipped with high optical access for UV, visible, and NIR light. The sealing technique must allow for the inclusion in the enclosure of the ion trap(s) of interest and ancillary elements, including an atomic source. During the course of Phase I, fused silica elements were successfully welded, using a femtosecond laser-based welding process, combined with a proprietary surface preparation procedure. Prototypes were fabricated and shown to have a measured leak rate of less than 1e- 12 atm*cc\/s, making them compatible with the envisioned UHV-applications. Further representative samples passed a series of stringent UHV helium leak tests, including tests conducted after cycling the test pieces to 77 K and to 473 K. The objective of the Phase II is to demonstrate the fabrication of permanently sealed and evacuated fused silica enclosures containing a linear Paul trap and an ion source. Means to measure the pressure inside this cubic-centimeter sealed enclosure will also be demonstrated."

        "Abstract": "Synchrotron and free-electron-laser facilities require diffraction gratings, with precisely defined specifications, for spectrometers and monochrometers on their X-ray and vacuum- ultraviolet (VUV) beamlines. With only 3 commercial suppliers worldwide, diffraction-grating availability is often constrained by long delivery times and high cost. Moreover, the techniques currently used by commercial suppliers to fabricate beamline gratings, i.e., holographic lithography or the inscribing of individual grating lines, are often unable to meet the demanding specifications, especially for absolute line-placement accuracy of variable line-space and curved-line gratings. In Phase I, company will make modifications to its zone-plate-array-lithography platform that will enable it to provide fast turn-around on variable line-space gratings on substrates thicker than 25mm, longer than 150 mm and with absolute line-placement accuracy of less than 20 nm. In Phase II, absolute line-placement accuracy of less than 10 nm will be demonstrated on substrates thicker than 25mm and longer than 250 mm. Also in Phase II, grating spatial periods in excess of 2400 lines per mm will be demonstrated as well as blazed grating in single-crystal silicon. In addition to capturing a substantial fraction of the world-wide commercial market for X-ray and vacuum-ultraviolet gratings, achieving sub-10nm absolute pattern-placement accuracy over large areas will open new markets. In particular, a market will be opened for high-accuracy computer-generated holograms on thick substrates, needed to provide reference wavefronts for interferometric null testing during the manufacture of aspheric, cylindrical and other free-form optical surfaces."

During the proposed Phase II program, we will further experimentally scale the fiber-coupled output power to 400 mW, by utilizing heatsinking advances and by increasing our materials joining technology capabilities. Laser devices will be demonstrated using a new custom laser package. Our lasers will meet the TR 4 level by the end of the program.

        "Abstract": "Turbine blades are traditionally manufactured using ?&apos;-precipitation strengthened nickel-based superalloys, such as Inconel 738 low carbon (IN738LC), due to their mechanical properties, e.g., fatigue properties and creep strength, at elevated temperatures, as well as their oxidation and corrosion resistance. New turbine blade designs also incorporate thermal barrier coatings and internal cooling pathways to safely push turbine inlet temperatures above the melting point of these superalloys, leading to improved turbine engine efficiency and increased power output. To achieve these inlet temperatures without melting the blades, modern gas turbine engines bleed air from the engine compressor through cooling channels within the turbine blades to extend engine lifetime. However, the complexity of the internal cooling networks for turbine blades are limited by the conventional casting process. Cellular lattice structures, which may provide improved cooling efficiency and additional weight savings, are currently not feasible. \u00a0 Recent advances in additive manufacturing (AM) technology, e.g., laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), have enabled the fabrication of near-net shape structures with complex geometries, e.g., cellular lattice structures. Therefore, LPBF is a potential manufacturing alternative to traditional casting process that can both enable more complex turbine blade designs with improved cooling efficiency and reduce lead times. Unfortunately, ?\u2019-precipitation strengthened nickel-based superalloys such as IN738LC are prone to cracking during the LPBF process due to the high temperature gradients and rapid solidification.\u00a0 \u00a0 Materials Sciences LLC (MSC) in partnership with the National Center for Additive Manufacturing Excellence (NCAME) at Auburn University (AU) propose the development of optimal AM process parameters for LPBF of IN738LC, to achieve geometric and material control while minimizing defects. Additionally, MSC and NCAME propose the fabrication of generic prototypes with internal cellular lattice structures to demonstrate the manufacturing feasibility of more complex internal networks for improved turbine blade cooling efficiency."

The 2021 IPCC report reconfirms previous IPCC reports since 2001 that clouds represent the largest uncertainty in climate models.nbsp; Arctic mixed-phase clouds have a major impact on surface radiative fluxes and energy balance, which are critical to understanding climate change. The objective of the proposed research is the development and flight-testing of a new airborne instrument, a Particle Phase Spectrometer (PPS), which will provide measurements of the ice and water phases in mixed-phase clouds.nbsp; These in situ measurements can be used to validate spaceborne microphysical retrievals and provide data that can be parameterized to improve climate prediction models. The PPS will discriminate small (~ 20 to 30 micron) water drops from ice particles in mixed-phase clouds.nbsp;The airborne PPS will be adapted from SPECrsquo;s commercial 3V-CPI, which combines a cloud particle imager (CPI) with 2.3 micron pixels and a 2D-S optical array probe with 10-micron resolution. The PPS will have 1-micron resolution and the 2D-S will be replaced with a 4-level 2D-Gray probe with 5-micron resolution. To achieve these goals requires substantial engineering and meticulous fabrication of components. The 1-micron resolution CPI is near the diffraction wavelength limit and requires precision optics that were developed in Phase I.nbsp; It also requires a high-power (200 W) pulsed laser with a 10 ns pulse length. The 5-micron 2D-Gray probe requires ultra-low noise amplification and FPGA (field programmable gate array) compression of large, high-rate data streams. The two airborne subsystems will be designed using solid modeling, fabricated and tested in the laboratory before being packaged into an airborne instrument and test-flown on the companyrsquo;s Learjet research aircraft.nbsp;"

        "Abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control, 14.2% of US adults report experiencing migraine symptoms within any\ngiven 3-month period, making it the second most disabling illness in the world. Diagnosed migraine is typically categorized\nas either episodic (2 \u2013 14 days per month) or chronic (15 or more days per month), with each attack accompanied by a\ncombination of debilitating pain and symptoms that persist between 4 - 72 hours. There is no absolute cure for migraine,\nand the overall financial burden associated with these disorders is more than $72B annually in the US and Europe. For\nindividuals affected, however, the personal \u201ccosts\u201d go well beyond financial and physical pain and are reflected in\ndecreased relationship satisfaction, increased dependency on caregivers, and loss of work and social productivity. Despite\nincreased recognition of parasympathetic activation of the trigeminovascular system through the SPG, the majority of\nacute migraine therapies target downstream effects of trigeminovascular activation, including CGRP receptors and 5-HT\nreceptors. Nonspecific pain medications used in migraine (acetaminophen, NSAIDs, opioids) may have a more direct anti-\nnociceptive effect on the trigeminovascular system, but they either lack adequate potency for severe migraine symptoms\nor cause significant adverse effects. Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) block procedures directly target the trigeminal nerve\nand have been identified as an effective, in-clinic method for reducing migraine symptoms that can be administered as\noften as needed without the potential for severe or addictive side effects. To date, these procedures have not been\nconsidered a strong alternative to front-line medications due to their 1) Necessity for administration by a trained\nhealthcare professional, 2) Difficult and uncomfortable route of administration, and 3) High supply and procedural costs\ncompared to single-dose medication. In response to the increasing clinical need for alternative migraine therapies, our\nteam comprised of migraine care specialists, device and drug developers, and clinical research specialists has created a\ntechnology for accurately delivering medication to the upper-posterior nasal cavity, enabling development of a self-\nadministered SPG block combination product that provides rapid pain relief without the harsh and addictive side effects\nof existing medications. The Principal Objectives of this Phase I SBIR, separated into two distinct Aims, are to establish\ntechnical efficacy and evaluate commercial design feasibility for self-administration \u2013 a critical component for treatment\nefficacy. In the first aim, components affecting nasal spray characteristics will be designed and prototyped. Benchtop and\nin vitro performance testing will be conducted using a surrogate nasal cast and laser diffraction techniques to measure\nand optimize droplet size, distribution patterns, drug substance delivery rate, total drug substance delivered, and nasal\ncavity deposition to ensure local drug application to the SPG while meeting specifications for function and safety based\non current recommendations for drug delivery devices. Aim 2 will focus on the creation of system-level designs for the\ndelivery device through formative human factors evaluations that will bring together diverse groups of migraine patients,\nclinical care professionals, and key opinion leaders. The conclusion of Aim 2 will be an FDA pre-IND meeting to obtain\nclarification on the regulatory pathway and preclinical and clinical testing to support a successful NDA application."

        "Abstract": "High quality color centers have been demonstrated at the laboratory level to support a number of exciting quantum technology applications in quantum information and optics, navigation and geoscience probes, and nano-sensing in condensed-matter physics, yet a manufacturable process for creating such color centers has yet to be developed. In the crystalline diamond material system, nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers have been utilized at the laboratory level to create a number of exciting quantum sensor and other quantum technology devices and components, many of which show high levels of performance during room temperature testing and evaluation. A clean, reliable, and reproducible manufacturable process for creating high quality diamond materials with NV centers which are controllably positioned, and which have optimized optical and spin properties is of great interest. The team of Great Lakes Crystal Technologies (GLCT) and its research partner Michigan State University (MSU) will apply and extend MSU\u2019s patented technology in microwave plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technology which GLCT has licensed, in combination with advanced femtosecond laser processing and materials characterization technologies developed at MSU to create ultra-high quality CVD diamond materials with controlled arrays of high performance NV centers which in turn will be used to advance the state of the art in magnetic field sensing. We will begin by synthesizing low strain isotopically purified diamond wafers which contain a thin high concentration layer of delta-doped nitrogen at a controllable distance from the surface. Next, we\u2019ll process the samples using lithography, advanced ion implantation and annealing. Specifically, we will activate a periodic array of NV centers in each wafer, using a femtosecond laser annealing process for one wafer and an electron beam irradiation and annealing process for the other wafer. Lastly, we\u2019ll characterize the wafers using photoluminescence spectroscopy and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy to compare their spectral responses, with the goal of understanding the best approach to take forward into Phase II. The proposed technology has a multitude of potential applications in quantum information and optics, navigation and geoscience probes, and nano-sensing in condensed-matter physics, and could inform many other diamond-based approaches to quantum encryption and quantum computing."

The game-changing innovation in the 2P-ActivityScope is the ability to perform\nunparalleled (i) optical imaging of neuronal activity in populations of neurons at subcellular spatial resolution and\ntemporal resolution in the millisecond range both in vivo and in vitro using a variety of fluorescent indicators (e.g.\nvoltage, [neurotransmitter]) as well as (ii) high-resolution volumetric calcium imaging of columns of cortical\nneurons at 40 Hz in vivo. These capabilities are crucial for ultimately decoding how information is represented\nand processed by the billions of densely interconnected neurons comprising the mammalian central nervous\nsystem. Neither contemporary 2-photon microscopes, functional magnetic resonance imaging, inserting\nelectrodes into the brain, or fiber photometry can serve this need. This project will disseminate and improve upon\nthe original, lab-built SLAP2 invention to create a commercial product for this important new technology. Based\non pilot work performed at Janelia, it is clear that the 2P-ActivityScope will make a significant impact on the field\nof neuroscience research, including advancing studies focused on alterations in CNS circuitry associated with\nneurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Ultimately, this will result in an\nimproved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for a wide spectrum of complex brain diseases. In\nPhase I we will demonstrate feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype hardware and software;\nwork in Phase II will focus on creating the full functionality of the 2P-ActivityScope for commercial release. We\nwill perform extensive feasibility studies, product validation and usability studies of the 2P-ActivityScope in close\ncollaboration with Dr. Podgorski and our academic collaboration partners. A competing technology is not\ncommercially available."

These capabilities are crucial for ultimately correlating stimuli and\/or behavioral states of an animal\ndiscretely, in a context-dependent manner, with the activity of all neurons in the brain of the animal that are\ninvolved in this process, which requires simultaneous recording of the activity of hundreds of thousands of\nneurons in a multi-regional and multi-layer manner. However, contemporary 2-photon microscopy suffers from\na fundamental limitation. Neuroscience researchers need to record simultaneous interactions between the\nsensory, motor and visual regions of the brain, but it is difficult to capture the activity in such a broad volume of\nthe brain without sacrificing resolution or speed. The LBM technology pushes the limits of imaging speed to the\nphysical nature of fluorescence itself by eliminating the \u201cdead time\u201d between sequential laser pulses when no\nneuroactivity is recorded and at the same time the need for scanning. With this approach, the only limit to the\nrate at which samples can be recorded is the time that it takes the tags to fluoresce, meaning wide volumes of\nthe brain can be recorded within the same time it would take a conventional two-photon microscope to capture\na much smaller number of brain cells. Other technology, such as miniaturized 2-photon microscopes that can be\ncarried on the head of freely moving rodents, functional magnetic resonance imaging, inserting electrodes into\nthe brain, or fiber photometry do not fulfill this need. This project will improve upon the original LBM invention to\ncreate a commercial product for disseminating this important new technology. Based on pilot work performed at\nDr. Vaziri&apos;s laboratory, it is clear that the vCAm will make a significant impact on the field of neuroscience\nresearch, including advancing studies focused on alterations in the circuitry of the central nervous system\nassociated with neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Ultimately, this will\nresult in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for a wide spectrum of complex brain\ndiseases. In Phase I we will demonstrate the feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype hardware\nand software; work in Phase II will focus on creating the full functionality of the vCAm for commercial release.\nWe will perform extensive feasibility studies, product validation and usability studies of the vCAm in close\ncollaboration with Dr. Vaziri. A competing technology is not commercially available."

        "Abstract": "Phase I demonstrated VCSELs capable of transmitting 76Gbps NRZ formatted data using existing Photonic Crystal VCSEL (PC-VCSELs). This was the fastest modulation of PC-VCSELs ever recorded. The data rate was limited by the bandwidth of the PC-VCSEL and in Phase II of this proposal, the plans developed in Phase I to address the laser transmitter limitations will be realized. The key technical objective is to develop a laser transmitter that in combination with the defined driver equalization and pulse shaping is capable of 100Gbps NRZ data transmission. The technical approach to the transmitter to be developed in phase II includes four fundamental and cooperative techniques. First, a VCSEL epitaxial structure supporting operation in the 940nm wavelength region will take advantage of higher differential gain and improved reliability when compared to the traditional wavelength of 850nm. An epitaxial structure with fundamental bandwidth in excess of 30GHz has been designed and multiple epi iterations will be processed in Phase II. The PC-VCSELs tested in Phase I had fundamental epitaxial bandwidth less than 20GHz. Second, to enhance the fundamental bandwidth of the VCSEL, a photonic crystal structure with two coherently locked cavities will be used. This coherence, demonstrated in Phase I exhibits a resonance that can be designed to be in the 10\u2019s of GHz range and thereby provides an \u201coptical feedback\u201d that extends the fundamental bandwidth of the laser. The design of the photonic crystal will be investigated theoretically and experimentally to increase the total power output. The objective is to engineer the mode to be resonant in the 50 to 60GHz range. This additional pole in the frequency response will increase the overall small signal bandwidth to 50GHz, but more importantly enable 100Gbps NRZ operation. Third, electronic equalization and pulse shaping will be optimized to support 100Gbps by making best use of the intrinsic coupled cavity behavior while minimizing complexity to ensure a deployable transmitter is demonstrated.\u00a0 In phase 1, traditional techniques of equalization and pulse shaping were shown to be effective with the PC-VCSELs. Measurements of Relative Intensity Noise, Bit Error Rates, and fiber coupling tolerances will also be made in phase II and will inform the packaging and control concepts to be developed in phase II. Work with a commercial laser driver manufacturer to develop the specifications and simulations for a commercial Driver IC will commence in Phase II. Fourth, packaging design will be optimized for minimizing parasitics while providing electrical connectivity to driver and coupling light into multi-mode fiber. The design will be iterated in Phase II and complete prototype package be demonstrated at the end of the option period for Phase II. Reliability and environmental operating tests will be performed on the first PC-VCSEL iteration in Phase II, and on the final PC-VCSEL and package in the phase II option period."

        "Abstract": "Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) solutions are readily available from the commercial sector in both single mode and multimode formats. However, these solutions are not readily adaptable to use in the harsh environmental conditions required by the Military and Aerospace segment, nor are they capable of the high passive loss requirements. For example, the commercially available solutions in the 850 to 940nm band (so called SWDM band) are typically rated from 0 to 70C and are manufactured using complex chip on board die placement and utilize molded plastic optics. Operation over extended temperature ranges and other environmental factors such as mechanical shock and vibration are not possible. Additionally, the receiver sensitivity is generally at -11dBm (OMA). Transceivers in the traditional telecom wavelength range of 1310 to 1550nm operate on single mode optical fiber, which has shown to not be robust in the Navy operating environment. Here we propose a wavelength multiplexed digital receiver that is capable in the extreme military environment that is built using traditional TO packaged receivers and a hermetic optical path. The design uses either a fiber pigtail or connectorized input, and the optical output is collimated through the assembly. A series of filters is used to separate the individual wavelengths and direct them to the individual photodetectors and TIAs. The TO can package includes a lens and will be actively aligned to the input laser beams. The TO can will be laser welded in place and back filled with epoxy to complete the hermetic assembly. An avalanche photodiode will be used in the receiver to improve the receiver sensitivity at 850nm to approximately -14dBm (OMA). Sensitivity in the 1310nm to 1550nm will also be improved due to improved responsivity of the APD by approximately 6dB.The overall assembly is readily customizable to any wavelength from 850nm to 1550nm with appropriate choice of filters and APDs. Additionally, the signaling speed of each channel can be readily customized to any rate up to 28Gbps, possibly even 28GBd, making the total data throughput 200Gbps. \u00a0Additional link margin can be obtained by increasing the launch power of the transmitter. PSI has also developed high speed lasers with dual lasing cavities to increase the average launch power by ~2.5dB, or a minimum power level of +2dBm. Taken together with the receiver sensitivity, this gives a total link budget of 16dB, and allows for 13dB of passive loss.\u00a0 Similar link margins are expected for a 1310 to 1550nm solution on single mode fiber. Traditional multimode fiber has limited bandwidth at 1310nm and imparts significantly more bandwidth penalty to the link. One method of reducing the link penalty would be to manufacture multimode optical fiber optimized for operation at 1310nm, providing bandwidth on par with the OM5 solution at 850nm. This would give TDP near 3dB, and provide passive link margin in excess of 14dB."

        "Abstract": "The need for higher speed supercomputing power at NASA is clear, and one of the many impairments to realizing an exaflop computer is the speed and latency of the data links that connect the processors and memory. Even with the advent of higher speed standards in Ethernet and Fibre Channel, the data throughput is crippled due to the need for non-binary encoding and error correction algorithms as a direct result of the limited bandwidth of the optical components. The induced latency and power consumption are acceptable in a data center environment but severely limits high performance computing. Efforts to increase the fundamental optical component bandwidth have not been successful in increasing to the point of achieving binary NRZ data transmission without error correction at 100Gbps. Binary NRZ is the most power and latency efficient means to transmit data in a super computing environment. A revolutionary optical component is needed to break the traditional paradigm. The laser and electro-absorptive modulator (laser-EAM) in this proposal represents many significant technical advancements including: (1) fundamental bandwidth in excess of 100GHz using direct band to band absorption, (2) very low power consumption (lt;150fJ\/bit), (3) operation over the entire environmental temperature range without a thermo-electric controller, (4) monolithic integration of the laser and EAM (5) potential to integrate a vertical outcoupler. The innovations that lead to these technical achievements are the design of a common active region for both the laser and EAM, and the use of enhanced coupling strength (ECS) gratings to provide wideband mirrors. This combination allows the laser emission to tune freely with temperature and the EAM absorption to track the laser. Further, the laser-EAM is realized in a single epitaxial growth, and the fabrication is completely monolithic. This provides a highly manufacturable and cost-effective solution to the optical component bandwidth problem."

        "Abstract": "The laser-based electron accelerator is an innovative tool to obtain GeV to TeV electron energies for high-energy particle physics experiments. The development of high-power laser systems for these accelerators, however, puts stringent challenges on the very limits of the laser materials themselves. The enormous heat generated by the high power creates great thermal stress that leads to effects such as birefringence, thermal lensing, or even physical fracture damage to the host. The issue can be mitigated by using fiber or thin-disk lasers with effective cooling. The next generation of accelerators, however, will require higher powers than can be produced by the current state-of-the-art.\nStatement of How the Problem is Being Addressed\nTo address this challenge, RMD and our STTR partner, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory will investigate the design and fabrication of thin-disk ceramic composite laser gain media with a 3-D doping profile. Ceramics offer other advantages over single crystals in providing the flexibility to tailor the doping concentration and profile with lower inherent cost, higher yield, relaxed constraints on size and shape, control of composition. In addition, ceramics are generally more robust than single crystals toward damage caused by thermal or mechanical shock. Yb-doped sesquioxide possesses a cubic structure and high thermal conductivity and is a well-known candidate for the short pulse, high-power laser gain media application.\nWhat will be done in Phase I?\nIn Phase I, we will synthesize transparent Yb-doped sesquioxide ceramic gain media as thin disks with a tailored dopant profile. The issues addressed will include modeling the structure and composition for the ceramic gain media material, the synthesis and qualification of the nano-sized powders with desired compositions, the consolidation of nano-sized powder into the composite green body with desired compositions and optical quality, and the dopant distribution profile, the densification of the green body into transparent ceramic disks, the optimization of the composition and dopant concentration profile for better efficiency and, finally, the characterization of thermal, mechanical and optical properties of the transparent gain media samples\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits\nThere are two target markets for our technology. The first segment consists of national labs and universities both in the U.S. and globally that will want to use our technology for scientific research and in current and future high power laser accelerators. This market is typically categorized as part of the scientific research and military market. Global revenue for laser systems used in the scientific research and military markets grew from $922 million in 2017 to $2.248 billion in 2020\nThe second market segment is the materials processing and lithography market. This market includes lasers used for all types of metal processing (welding, cutting, annealing, drilling); semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing (lithography, scribing, defect repair, via drilling); The lithography equipment segment is used to print complex circuit patterns on silicon wafers that are mainly raw materials for integrated circuits. This process is considered to be one of the most expensive and critical steps in wafer fabrication."

        "Abstract": "A cyber-physical trust anchor is an essential component of a secure additive manufacturing supply chain. Customer discussions show a strong need for low-cost trust anchors as well as high-security, more costly trust anchors. The concept underlying our trust anchor enables implementations that can be described as good, better, best. The two physical-digital components are first embedded digital codes represented as\ncryptographic hashes and inherent physical texture represented as perceptual hashes. Combinations of embedded codes and inherent texture combined with cryptographic and perceptual hashes yield cyber-physical trust anchors having a convenient range of security and implementation costs.\nThis project will assess the implementation costs and the security provided for several cyber-physical trust anchors in additive manufacturing.\nThe writing costs will be explored for stereolithography, powder bed laser, and friction stir additive manufacturing. The reading costs will be evaluated with 2D X-ray conventional imaging and grating-based interferometry. The digital costs and security will be assessed with varied bitlengths of cryptographic and perceptual hashes. Attack vectors will be proposed in Phase I and corresponding risk assessments developed in Phase II. The work is performed in a collaboration between Refined Imaging (AM, X-ray), SIMBA Chain (blockchain) and Prof. Michele Maasberg (cyber security)."

        "Abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nWe propose to develop a novel contact, label-free multimodality-based sensing probe that provides real-time\nintraoperative identification of nerves within the thermal damage threshold range of a surgical tool. The tool will\nfacilitate prevention of direct\/indirect nerve damage (termed iatrogenic nerve injury) during surgical procedures,\nas they are a major source of postsurgical complications, e.g., chronic pain. In the United States, chronic pain\nmanagement is a major complicit factor in the ongoing opioid-related drug overdose epidemic. Annually, over 45\nmillion surgical procedures are performed in the United States and an estimated 10% to 50% of them result in\nchronic postoperative pain patient outcomes. Though not every one of the at least 4.5 million chronic pain cases\nare definitively ascribable to iatrogenic nerve injury, it nonetheless represents a significant recurrent annual\nhealthcare problem. Relatedly, analysis of large-scale nerve lesion treatment studies ascribes 25%, 60% and\n94% respectively of sciatic, femoral and accessory nerve lesions addressed to iatrogenic nerve injury.\nAdditionally, iatrogenic nerve injury features prominently in post-surgical quality of life issues that range from\nloss of sensation and motor function, to the aforementioned chronic pain, and morbidity. Reportedly, 2-3 years\npost radical prostatectomy ~60% of men are still impotent as a result of damaged cavernous nerves. Likewise,\n20% - 60% of mastectomy breast cancer treatment survivors suffer chronic post-surgical pain that significantly\nreduces their quality of life, and injury to the intercostobrachial nerve is the primary cause. Even in surgeries with\nminimal neural damage risk like acoustic neuroma removal (andlt;1%), spinal scoliosis surgery (andlt;0.6%), and\nthyroidectomy (andlt;2-3.8%) the consequences of nerve damage can be severe: leading to deafness, paraplegia,\nand even death respectively. The associated financial implications of iatrogenic nerve damage are significant.\nThere are direct financial costs to the individual due to loss of employment and\/or income, and to the healthcare\nindustry as nerve damage is a common source of litigation with compensation being awarded in 82% of cases\nof spinal accessory nerve injury, for an example. The exposure of healthcare personnel and providers to\nmedicolegal liability is extensive as Iatrogenic nerve injuries are commonly reported on the laryngeal nerve\nduring thyroid operations, trigeminal nerve and inferior alveolar nerve during facial and oral surgeries, intercostal\nnerves during thoracic surgeries, and on the spinal accessory nerves, common peroneal nerve, superficial radial\nnerve, and genitofemoral nerve branches during various other surgeries. Consequently, as of 2015, medicolegal\nlitigation risk was a primary driver for a $2.2 billion global market for intraoperative nerve monitoring projected to\ngrow annually at 4.79% until 2025. Our proposed solution targets filling both the deficiencies of currently available\noptions and the growing demand by introducing an effective, commercially viable product. Our proof-of-concept\nstudy targets highly consequential surgical cancer treatment thyroidectomy procedures.PROJECT NARRATIVE\nProliferation in the use of minimal-blood-loss thermal-based surgical incision devices, such as surgical lasers\nelectro-surgery tools or ultrasonic scalpels, have made the related collateral thermal damage to adjacent and\nsurrounding tissues and structures a significant problem. In particular, the unintended damage to unidentified\nproximally embedded nerves during surgical procedures are a significant and costly public healthcare delivery\nproblem in urgent need of a solution as the current methods are inadequate in preventing surgical-tool-use\nrelated collateral damage. The consequences of increased healthcare costs linked to medical-liability issues and\nthe significant erosion in quality-of-life issues that include the escalation in chronic pain management opioid-use-\nrelated drug overdose epidemic, make addressing this highly impactful to society."

        "Abstract": "While phosphorus is a critical nutrient for all forms of life, runoff leads to phosphorus accumulation in surface water where it can cause a variety of health, environmental, and economic problems. The Department of Energy is interested in conducting long-term field experiments to monitor the impact of phosphorus in terrestrial and aquatic environments, and to better understand a cost vs. benefit analysis of reducing phosphorus pollution. Performing such long-term experiments requires affordable sensors capable of monitoring low-level phosphorus concentrations under challenging environmental conditions. However, such sensors are currently not available. The goal of this proposed project is to develop and demonstrate a low-cost portable phosphorus sensor suitable for in situ measurements. The project will determine the technical requirements for a Raman-based sensor system, design and build a signal amplifier, integrate it with a Raman-based sensor, and demonstrate a proof-of-concept level sensor system. The expected accomplishments for Phase I include the identification of the technical requirements of a combined Raman laser\/spectrometer and cavity enhancement system, building a proof-of-concept level sensor system capable of detecting orthophosphate compounds at the desired level, and verification of the sensor performance under laboratory and field conditions. In addition, the project will identify initial hardening requirements that will need to be implemented during Phase II. While the project plans to develop an integrated sensor system for monitoring phosphorus, the cavity-based enhancement system can also be used in combination with other (non-phosphorus) Raman sensors that ExMat plans to develop or that are already commercially available. A recent market report highlights the increasing demand for such environmental monitoring applications, with the market for chemical detection anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6.5% (2020-2025). Wide-spread monitoring of phosphorus could reduce the damage from eutrophication in freshwater, which is estimated to be $2.2 billion annually, thereby increasing biodiversity, reducing costs required for drinking water treatment, and decreasing economic losses related to recreation and angling and lake property values."

The OTC technology is based on two-color fluorescence thermometry to determine the temperature. After laser excitation, the emission intensities at two wavelengths are monitored and, after calibration, the ratio of the intensities is used to determine the temperature. While we previously demonstrated the technical feasibility of the OTC, during Phase II we will focus on: (1) developing a process that results in reproducible sensor coatings with optimized fluorescence intensity; (2) selecting, evaluating, and implementing a signal detection and amplification process; and (3) designing and implementing a hardened and ruggedized OTC design that provides shock control, temperature control, and dust control suitable for use during field tests."

        "Abstract": "The development of high average-power lasers is fundamentally challenged by the onset of thermally induced birefringence in typical gain media. This depolarization caused by birefringence is spatially dependent and difficult to correct. The result is a significant loss of energy and beam uniformity. The best-known solutions for this problem involve paired numbers of passes through identically stressed gain media with some means of rotating the beam polarization 90-degrees, wholesale. The subsequent pass will then undo the effects of the prior pass with varying degrees of success. This is not always feasible given the cost and complexity of adding amplifier stages and\/or the costs (or even existence) of the optics required to rotate the polarization. Other solutions include changing the gain configuration so that the thermal stresses are along the axis of the gain instead of radially. This translates to not using cylindrical rod amplifiers and forgoing the many design and efficiency benefits associated with rods.The novel solution proposed here is the implementation of phase retarder plates which uses a custom fabricated metasurface to convert linearly polarized light into radially or azimuthally polarized light, and then back again. The thermally induced birefringent axes of YAG and glass-based amplifier rods are in the radial and azimuthal direction. Thus, such a change in polarization would prevent the laser from seeing the birefringence and eliminate the depolarization effect. During the Phase I, Voss Scientific demonstrated fabrication of nanostructures which showed a high degree of polarization control.\nDepolarization mitigation using radially polarized light was also demonstrated using a lower-power- handling, commercial phase retarder as a surrogate for the metasurface phase retarder. Metasurfaces fabricated using silicon were tested for their laser induced damage threshold (LIDT) which was found to be less than 200 mJ\/cm2 for 1-ns pulses at 1064 nm. Alternative materials to silicon were identified and also tested for LIDT which exceeded 1.5 J\/cm2. During the Phase II project, the metasurface will be redesigned and optimized using the new materials. Fabrication techniques using silicon should be directly transferable. The goal of the Phase II project is the demonstration of a laser system that uses the metasurface phase retarder.The successful demonstration of the technology proposed will enable the drastic reduction in size, complexity, and cost of high average-power lasers and just as importantly, greatly improve beam quality. Furthermore, mechanism by which the metasurface works to mitigate birefringence works independent of changes in the magnitude of the thermal birefringence in the gain. In principle, the metasurface optics can be scaled to very large apertures, making them uniquely suitable for use in high energy (&gt;100 J) lasers, like those sought by the DOE. A broad range of potential applications for such lasers exist, including hadron therapy, isotope production, and inertial fusion energy."

        "Abstract": "The length of most accelerator magnets is much greater than the diameter, and therefore the loss in effective length from the ends (about a coil diameter in dipoles) is relatively small. However, for short magnets, such as some envisioned for the Interaction Region (IR) of the Electron Ion Collider (EIC), the end effects of the conventional cosine theta design will result in a relatively large reduction in magnetic length. This proposal is for developing an alternate optimum integral design which significantly reduces the loss of effective length due to the ends. In the optimum integral design approach, the ends become an integral part of the magnet in optimizing the cosine theta current distribution, thereby creating a higher integral field for the same coil length. The more compact design is critical when available space is limited as in the EIC. As a part of Phase I, we ported and further developed the codes for optimizing the optimum integral design. The lower cost of direct wind technology allowed us to design, build, and successfully test a proof-of-principle 1.7 T, 114 mm aperture, 600 mm long, 2-layer superconducting dipole based on the optimum integral design, a significant feat for a Phase I program. The goal of Phase II will be to demonstrate the optimum integral design for EIC IR dipole B0ApF. This will be a 3.8 T, 114 mm aperture, 600 mm long superconducting dipole, which is well beyond what has been demonstrated with direct wind technology so far. The magnet will also meet the field quality requirements. It is an ambitious goal for an SBIR\/STTR program but one that we believe can be achieved based on the strong performance of Phase I. Finally, we will examine the applicability of the optimum integral design to other EIC magnets and for other applications, such as medical and accelerator beam lines where compact, medium field superconducting magnets are required. A direct wind magnet based on the optimum integral design will create higher quality fields and have lower adverse end effects than conventional designs making it ideal for uses wherein space is at a premium. Demonstration of the direct wind magnet based on the optimum integral design is expected to provide a superior technical solution and reduce the cost of developing and building such magnets. These magnets should find widespread use in particle accelerators for research and medical applications."

        "Abstract": "Fossil fuels have been the leading energy source over the past century. In addition to the environmental and climatic tolls that use of fossil fuels entails, they are limited resources and will run out eventually. Therefore, it is imperative to develop sustainable renewable-energy sources and supporting infrastructures within the next few decades. Plant-cell walls are the most abundant biomaterials on Earth, where abundant solar energy is captured and stored in the form of polysaccharides. If this abundant energy can be efficiently extracted from the polymer materials, these plant materials will serve as a viable renewable-energy source. Furthermore, use of plant cell walls as bioenergy feedstock is particularly attractive for carbon emission control because plants sequester carbon and offer net negative greenhouse emissions. However, despite extensive research, many details of the cell wall synthesis and dynamics remain unknown. Because plant-cell walls mainly consist of carbohydrates not suitable for genetic tagging, alternative imaging-based research tools are highly desirable. To address the Department of Energy (DOE) need, Hedgefog Research Inc. (HFR) proposes to develop a Quantum Enabled Non-destructive Optical Microscopy (QENOM). Adopting a light source with intrinsic quantum properties absent in \u201cclassical\u201d light sources such as lasers or LEDs, QENOM will allow in-vivo studies of biological processes occurring within tissue without causing photo-damages, thereby providing 2D\/3D microscope images of the biological features in the target volume. The goal of the proposed development is to demonstrate the feasibility of the QENOM technology for use in in-vivo depth imaging of plant-cell walls. In Phase I, we plan to achieve two main objectives: (1) demonstrate that the quantum-correlated light source adopted in QENOM enables non-destructive depth imaging of biological samples relevant in plant-based bioenergy applications, and (2) develop a QENOM prototype allowing compact system integration and turn-key operation. The Phase I study will provide system performance metrics in microscopy applications with plant samples and allow development of a preliminary QENOM prototype design for the full-scale feasibility demonstration in Phase II. A viable, renewable, and sustainable domestic energy source ensures future energy security, mitigates climatic\/environmental impacts, and boosts the national and global economy. To use plant walls as a viable energy source, technical challenges present in efficient conversion of lignocelluloses in plant walls into sugars\/lignins need to be addressed. QENOM is a unique bioimaging tool that allows in-vivo depth imaging of plant cell walls, thereby advancing our understanding of key dynamic processes in synthesis\/assembly, modification, and degradation of plant cell walls. The biofuel market is a multi-billion industry with a significant growth potential in the future as the renewable energy sources replace fossil fuels. With its vast land and favorable climate, the U.S. will be the major biofuel-producing country, which will greatly improve energy independence and trade balance. In addition to the target applications in bioenergy research, in-vivo depth imaging of biological samples\/tissues is extremely important in clinical, medical, pharmaceutical, and biological research. QENOM will have a unique technical advantage in enabling prolonged in-vivo studies in these fields."

        "Abstract": "There is an urgent need to rapidly test warfighters and their surrounding environment for disease-causing pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. Existing methods for identifying pathogens in people usually require significant time and sample preparation. In addition, detecting pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 in the air presents an even greater challenge. To meet the DoD need for field portable bioaerosol identification via mass spectrometry that can detect pathogens in the breath of warfighters and in the surrounding air, Hedgefog Research Inc. proposes to develop an Aerosol Ionization Mass Spectrometer (AIMS). The AIMS device will be a single aerosol particle mass spectrometer that will search for mass spectrometric evidence of pathogens on individual atmospheric aerosol particles. The AIMS device will also use the laser induced fluorescence from the aerosol particles to provide additional evidence for the presence of biomolecules. In Phase I HFR will demonstrate the feasibility of the AIMS technology. Additionally, in Phase I HFR will design a full-scale prototype for Phase II manufacture and testing."

        "Abstract": "Precisely tuned electromagnetic fields can manipulate particles with electric charges and are used to achieve good beam characteristics in particle accelerators. Continuous monitoring and determination of magnetic fields in beam lines are crucial. The major technical issue with current magnetic-field probes is the limited operation lifetime in high-radiation environments. Commonly used nuclear magnetic resonance probes tend to have lifetime of less than several weeks, limiting operational efficiency and increasing cost of operation. The development of a radiation-hard magnetic fieldprobe offering prolonged operation over ~ 1 year is highly desirable. Hedgefog Research Inc. (HFR) is developing a Radiation Hardened Opto-atomic Magnetometer (RHOM) for magnetic-field sensing applications in high-radiation environments. This solution is a new approach to magnetometry that offers intrinsic radiation hardness guaranteed by design. The RHOM probe modules are built with radiation-hardened components, thereby offering a long, uninterrupted magnetic field sensing operation. HFR assembled and tested a compact probe prototype and confirmed that it can provide field measurement meeting the technical requirements of the application at high-energy target facilities. HFR established a data-acquisition and signal-processing scheme, which enables determination of the local magnetic flux density at the probe via comparison of experimental data with quantum- mechanical simulation results. HFR also performed radiation hardness testing of optical fiber in neutron-rich environments, which allows us to project operation lifetime of RHOM. Finally, HFR developed system design and down-selected system components for a RHOM prototype to be constructed in the next phase of the development. With the completion of the full technical feasibility demonstration achieved in Phase II, HFR plans to continue system integration, packaging, and software development in Phase IIA. HFR will construct and test an integrated prototype, which will include fully assembled probe and laser\/control modules and allow fully automated magnetic-field sensing. HFR will also test the radiation hardness of the entire sensor module. The Phase IIA development will position HFR for technology transition and productization. Many high-radiation environments, including nuclear fusion reactors, accelerators, military\/space applications, and high-energy physics laboratories, require magnetic-field sensors with long operation lifetime. A radiation-hard magnetic-field probe offering prolonged operation can replace the older sensors that limit operational efficiencies due to the short lifetime and suffer from catastrophic failures above device-specific damage thresholds, leading to abrupt interruption of the operation. The new solution will benefit users from many disciplines with direct commercial applications, including nuclear medicine and materials science."

        "Abstract": "DOE\u2019s Office of Biological and Environmental Research aims to better predict the Earth system to inform domestic policy. In response to this challenge, DOE is researching clouds and their impact on the global climate. To better understand cloud dynamics, researchers need to make very rapid, in situ measurements of water vapor concentration and temperature in the supersaturated regions in clouds. Similar measurements are also needed for greenhouse gases to better understand carbon fluxes. This Small Business Innovative Research program involves the development of compact, lightweight analyzers for very rapid, in-situ monitoring of water vapor concentration and air temperature aboard airborne platforms. The analyzers use tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy to make real-time, first-principles measurements of both parameters with no memory effects. The resulting systems will be used to study supersaturation and better understand cloud dynamics. These instruments will also be extended to measure greenhouse gases. In Phase I, technical feasibility was demonstrated by developing, testing, and deploying a compact, lightweight prototype instrument for high-speed measurements of water vapor concentration and gas temperature. The prototype, which measured 30 x 17 x 20 cm, weighed 2.2 kg, and used &lt; 10 Watts, provided a precision of better than \u00b115 ppm and \u00b10.24 K (1?, 100 Hz) for gas concentration and temperature respectively with excellent linearity. The instrument was deployed for eddy flux and airborne studies. During the latter, the analyzer was mounted to an unmanned aerial vehicle and underwent a series of repeated vertical flights. This flight data showed high-frequency dynamics and indicated the technical feasibility of using the technology to make airborne, high-speed measurements of water vapor and temperature. In Phase II, four fast water flux instruments will be developed, testing, deployed, and delivered. The first instrument will target terrestrial monitoring at an Ameriflux site. The seconds unit will be deployed aboard DOE\u2019s ArcticShark unmanned aerial vehicle for low-lying atmospheric studies. The third analyzer will be designed for DOE\u2019s Bombardier Challenger 850 to allow for higher altitude studies. The final system will be deployed aboard DOE\u2019s tethered balloon systems for slower atmospheric profiling. Finally, the airborne instruments will be delivered to specific Atmospheric Radiation Measurement facilities. The terrestrial unit will be extended to measure greenhouse gases for fast carbon flux studies. In addition to studying climate change, the proposed technology has applicability for measuring trace gases in the semiconductor industry and turbulent flux for the Department of Defense\u2019s high-power laser, directed energy applications."

        "Abstract": "The program addresses a critical need for a key component of an ultra-high optical power isolator that enables the next generation of kilowatt-class ultrafast laser systems to use in many areas of accelerator applications. This program provides this important laser component to realize novel accelerator concepts for future colliders; in the generation, manipulation, and x-ray seeding of electron beams; in the generation of electromagnetic radiation ranging from THz to gamma rays; and in the generation of the neu tron, proton, and light ion beams. With applications demanding ever higher fluxes of particles and radiation, the driving laser technology must also increase in repetition rate-and hence average power-to meet the demand. Presently, no vendor can provide a large aperture isolator with power handling exceeding kW.Objective: The program aims to develop a new generation of free-space optical isolators with significantly higher optical power handling than presently available to reach beyond kW pulse and CW operations.Phase I work: Phase I is targeted to produce a prototype free space isolator capable of 1 kW with transmission exceeding 95% and isolation exceeding 30 dB across the entire 5% bandwidth. A scaled-down functional prototype BIG-based isolator (bismuth substituted rare-earth iron garnet) with an aperture size of 30mm in diameter will be built in Phase I to validate the approach. The unit will be extensively tested at our in-house facility to demonstrate its optical performance and thermomechanical stability. Analysis and plan will be completed that provides a path to extend the design to 100 kW average power operation.Commercial Application: In addition to the scientific communi ty, The proposed next-generation high power optical isolators have direct Application in the high power laser commercial market. The global industrial laser market was over $3 billion last year."

        "Abstract": "Geologic carbon storage (GCS) is a promising technology used to lower the net release of CO2 into the atmosphere. Herein, the CO2 is captured and injected into deep geological formations, e.g., saline aquifers. The underlying premise behind success of this technology is that the stored CO2 does not escape from the host formations. However, the interaction of CO2 with the reservoir rocks, causes reactions that release metal contaminants into shallow groundwater aquifers. Monitoring of groundwater for elevated levels of dissolved metal contaminants such as Ca, K, Sr, etc., could provide an early detection of CO2 leakage needed for long-term CO2 sequestration monitoring. Technologies are also needed for direct and in situ measurements of greenhouse gases, CO2 and CH4 for assessment of air, water and soil quality required for environmental monitoring. For in situ measurements and real-time analysis, we propose to employ the DOE patented split laser measurement technology (SLMT) for laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to measure elemental species (Ca, K, Sr) and Raman spectroscopy to measure CO2 and CH4 under harsh environmental conditions relevant to fossil energy and carbon management. A significant part of the effort will be devoted to the upgrade of the current SLMT by incorporating innovative packaging and sealing of the sensor head for ruggedness and to withstand harsh environments during underwater and downhole sensing applications. The proposed system will support laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and Raman scattering measurements of gases, liquids, and solids. There is a great need in providing an inexpensive and compact measurement device suitable for harsh environments underground and on the surface to monitor elemental species such as Ca, K, Sr, etc. for detection of CO2 leakage, and dissolved greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 for groundwater monitoring in real time. The capability of LIBS and Raman scattering enables real-time assessment of air, water, and soil quality, which is highly important to oil and gas exploration companies, landowners, regulatory agencies, municipalities, and any organization measuring emissions and pollutants."

        "Abstract": "The Phase II research will develop and demonstrate non-destructive techniques\/tools for detecting internal voids and defects in additive manufactured (AM) components that can cause premature in-service failures and reduced fatigue life of specific components of interest to MDA. Candidate components under consideration include liquid-cooled rocket nose tips and nozzles, reinforcement structures, and critical items that could be printed in the field where they are put into use. Laser Acoustic Resonance Spectroscopy (LARS) is based on the idea that every object has a unique vibrational spectrum that is sensitive to the material properties of the object, including defects, flaws, material properties, residual stress, and dimensions. Analysis of this information-rich signal measured with a laser Doppler vibrometer can reveal changes in a part, such as defects and any other flaws that modify the vibrational signature and cause it to differ from a known reference signature of a flight-ready component. The research will build on and apply the fundamental knowledge and methods developed in Phase I, which were demonstrated through theory, experiment, and testing-to-failure to be valid for relatively simple components that contained programmed printed defects. These techniques were also shown to be applicable to more complex and MDA-relevant components through computer modeling. The Phase II work will work with a selection of AM components that are planned for actual use in aerospace application by MDA and its prime contractors. In Phase II, we will 1) demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that defects of interest in relevant AM parts are detectable with LARS, 2) develop a practical method for determining useful LARS reference spectra for individual AM components, 3) validate LARS predictions through mechanical tests to failure, 4) develop additional data extraction and interpretation techniques to better characterize defects, and 5) develop a Phase II prototype NDE instrument for use by MDA or one of its prime contractors. We will print AM the parts that include defects that are anticipated to cause problems in the part\u2019s function. Printing multiple parts in a single run is cost-effective and allows testing for more than one type of defect, provides statistics, and allows comparisons to improve the reliability of results. All selected test components will be analyzed with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to provide reference spectra and to predict the effect of defects on the LARS signature. FEA will also be employed to determine the detectability of defects by the LARS-based NDE instrument. All printed parts will be fully characterized with LARS measurements, which will be correlated with FEA predictions and mechanical test results to demonstrate the capability of LARS to detect defects that can cause failure for complex and relevant parts. This research will lead to the design and construction of a prototype NDE instrument. Approved for Public Release | 22-MDA-11102 (22 Mar 22)"

        "Abstract": "STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nMany of the quantum phenomena most relevant to ongoing research in nanotechnology and microelectronics occur at a spatial scale of nanometers and an energetic scale of 100 \u00b5eV. This unique combination makes them extremely difficult to study experimentally. Most existing methods of spectroscopy can reach either the spatial or energetic resolution but not both. In other cases, like X-ray spectroscopy, the probe particle has such low interaction cross-sections that many nanostructures cannot be effectively studied. Improvements on existing spectroscopy methods are needed to support ongoing computing and semiconductor research. TECHNICAL APPROACH\nA cold plasma cathode (CPC) is proposed to extend the energy resolution of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), which has nanometer spatial resolution, to the 100 \u00b5eV level. CPC is based on the continuous, shaped, two-photon ionization of alkali gas in molecular flow. The ionization of low-density gas by narrow bandwidth laser allows for a near-uniform emission process. The shaping of the plasma to a quasi-2D region by controlling laser optics leverages nonlinear space-charge behavior to limit scattering, achieving, in particle-tracking simulations, an energy spread of \u02dc1 \u00b5eV\/pA. PHASE I PLANS\nThe Phase I project aims to develop a prototype CPC. In this proposal, an alkali gas source, laser system, and accelerating plate setup will be constructed using the precision machining capability and vacuum infrastructure at RadiaBeam. Extraction of charges from shaped ionization regions will be demonstrated, by controlling the path of the lasers and the gas, and characterized to compare with simulation results. Further computational studies on the geometric dependence of space-charge effects in a cold plasma cathode will be performed. Phase II subsystems, such as an appropriate energy resolution characterization system will be designed. In Phase II, an ultra-high resolution EELS beamline will be constructed with the CPC as its electron source. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS\nThe program results will yield a prototype cold plasma cathode that will enable EELS at a previously inaccessible energy resolution for both academic and commercial condensed matter physics research. Among other things, it can be used to further understand quantum materials, superconductors, and semiconductor nanostructures. In addition to aiding nanotechnology and microelectronics research, the improved EELS capability will support research in material science, surface chemistry, and even structural biology."

        "Abstract": "Structure-based wakefield accelerators (SWFA) are the most promising solution for the\ndevelopment of TeV-class linear electron-positron colliders and X-ray Free Electron Lasers\n(XFELs). Several groups, including Argonne National Laboratory, are developing novel highgradient\nmm-wave accelerating structures for SFWA. These structures have been already tested\nwith the electron beam, but further development is limited by the lack of diagnostic tools such as\nan integrated offset monitor (IOM). This tool is needed ensure that the beam is centered inside the\nstructure. Failure to provide this condition will lead to beam instabilities and bream breakup.\nTechnical Approach\nWe propose to develop and build an IOM detector system that employs a fast Schottky envelope\ndetector and measures the signal amplitude and modulation. This design will be based on a mmwave\nheterodyne detector for RF breakdown diagnostics in accelerating structures that was\nrecently developed by RadiaBeam. The two main challenges that would be solved during this\nproject are the ability to detect 1.3 ns pulses with enough resolution, which is about an order\nmagnitude shorter that was achieved during the previous experiments, and to filter-out a very\nstrong high-frequency background signal caused by higher order modes (HOM) of the waveguide.\nPhase I Plans\nThe proposed IOM design would be built up in two steps, with one building on the other. The\nPhase I design would employ a fast Schottky envelope detector and would measure the signal\namplitude and modulation. We will adjust the circuitry around the Schottky diode to reduce its\nRC-time constant. We will also employ a bandpass filter to reject the background signal above 340\nGHz and pass the signal at 190 GHz, using the quasi-optical approach (grating). In Phase II we\nwill develop and build a heterodyne frequency downconverter, which would provide precise\nfrequency information about the signal.\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits\nThe proposed monitor will allow the advancement of ultra-compact terahertz wakefield\naccelerators, enabling miniaturization of many future DOE accelerator facilities. In addition to the\napplications in SWFA, the detector can also be used for real-time THz source characterization,\nhigh-gradient mm-wave accelerators and FEL projects."

        "Abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will improve the environment with cleaner diesel engine exhaust. Diesel engine manufacturers currently cannot precisely control their exhaust after-treatment systems due to the lack of widely deployable sensors that can differentiate between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and other species in the exhaust stream.This project advances a novel on-board sensor for detecting NOx in diesel exhaust streams with sensitivities and molecular specificity unmatched by existing technologies. It can result in 10% greater fuel efficiency while matching new stringent NOx emissions standards. Fleet-wide fuel economy improvements and NOx emissions reductions enabled by this technology will lead to reduced carbon emissions and healthier air with lower amounts of NOx-induced smog, ground-level ozone, and acid rain.The intellectual merit of this project advances a novel application of laser-absorption spectroscopy, which probes the unique spectral absorption fingerprint of NOx species to avoid cross-species interference. This sensor is projected to achieve tenfold lower detection thresholds than current widely deployed electrochemical sensors in the harsh high-temperature particulate-laden diesel exhaust environments, all while maintaining a form factor similar to those used in existing diesel aftertreatment systems. This Phase I research will leverage novel manufacturing techniques to fabricate and demonstrate the performance of a high-sensitivity laser-based NO sensor capable of surviving high-temperature, oxidizing, intensely vibrating, and particulate-laden flows characteristic of vehicle exhaust gases.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Mature solid state pulsed mid-IR laser technology will be adapted to diode-pumped and CW operation to support GHz bandwidth free space optical communications (FSOC). A primary challenge is how to continuously depopulate the lower layer level while the system is producing laser output. Such depopulation is needed in order to achieve CW operation. We will develop approaches that preserve the highest possible overall efficiency, and that are compatible with scaling the laser output power to 5 watts during Phase II. Existing wideband mid-IR modulation techniques will be adapted to the FSOC application. Since currently available modulation techniques in this wavelength band have greater insertion loss than the more mature modulation techniques used in shorter wavelength FSOC systems, a master oscillator power amplifier approach will be considered for the laser transmitter to maximize overall system efficiency. Possibilities for spatial modulation, such as use of multiple orbital angular momentum states in the transmitted beam, will be considered in optimization of covertness and system power efficiency."

We have developed two competing designs for NGA212-001. The first design utilizes\u00a0KTP, exhibits low half-wave voltage, high transmission,\u00a0high laser damage threshold\u00a0and can be operated to repetition rates over 500 kHz. While this design is ideal for laser pulse picking, it has difficulty achieving the\u00a0wide-angular field required for imaging. The second utilizes a unique, custom longitudinal field design that offers very wide-angle capability and repetition rate to &gt;100 kHz with 90% transmission. While this design is ideal for range-gated\u00a0imaging, the laser damage threshold must be evaluated for laser pulse picking. Both designs utilize\u00a0birefringent compensation to improve the off-axis performance. Our Phase I effort will use extensive modeling and simulation to predict the performance of each design for gated imaging, countermeasure protection\u00a0and laser pulse picking (NGA-212 requirements) as a function of repetition rate, voltage and ray angle (off-axis). This model will be validated by building a rapid prototype of one of the cells in Phase I and comparing the performance to model calculations. The objective is to mature the design to sufficient detail that a Preliminary Design can be completed\u00a0early in Phase II to enable the build of two prototypes in Phase II. By executing a\u00a0build, test, build strategy,\u00a0the unit delivered in Phase II (Breadboard #2) can employ the lessons learned from Breadboard #1."

At present, there are no commercially available materials capable of meeting the high strength and extreme low loss required for the head window. TIPD, LLC proposes to develop a new, environment-friendly, wide spectral band, high optical transmission, and high strength hydrophobic submarine beam director head window material based on novel germanate glasses with nanostructured random antireflection coating (RAR) coating providing hydrophobic and non-fouling properties that will meet all Navy\u2019s requirements.

        "Abstract": "280-300 nm spectral region is part of ozone absorption spectrum, and lasers operating in this region might be used for lidar measurements. For example, the pulsed UV laser system is used by NASA for the Langley mobile ozone lidar (LMOL) operates in precisely that region. This system output is a train of alternating pulses at two distinct wavelengths from 285-300 nm spectral range. The laser active medium is a Ce:LiCAF crystal pumped by a quadrupled radiation from a Q-switched Nd:YLF laser. Such a laser scheme is bulky and has low efficiency: with 0.2 W of UV output power the system consumes 2 kW, so overall wall-plug efficiency is 0.01%. TIPD proposes to develop a simple, compact, robust, and efficient laser source based on GaN diodes and Tb-doped gain materials to satisfy NASArsquo;s requirements. In this phase I program, we will demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed laser source by developing a novel efficient Tb-doped oscillator."

        "Abstract": "For deep space optical communications at astronomical distances such as Mars and beyond, a multi-kW average power laser that can be coded to send data is needed. Optical communication will revolutionize space-based science and exploration capabilities by supplying data rates up to 100 times faster than the currently used radio frequency based systems. New science will be enabled as missions become capable of hosting instruments that require substantial bandwidth, such as hyperspectral imagers and instruments with high definition in spectral, spatial, or temporal modes. The key to efficient optical communication encompasses the ability to generate the optical power efficiently, aim the narrow beam accurately enough to illuminate a receiver on Earth, and to collect and detect the received optical signal with minimal loss after passing through the atmosphere. A fundamental concept of operation is that the deep space transceiver uses an uplink beacon from Earth as a reference for pointing the downlink. This is done to minimize the mass and power of the subsystem on the spacecraft that accurately points the downlink laser beam.In response to NASArsquo;s solicitation to develop a multi-kW laser to use as a ground beacon and uplink laser transmitter, PSI is proposing to develop a simple and innovative fiber design that can produce gt; 3 kW of average power and 6 kW of peak power at 50% duty cycle.nbsp; The laser will be modulated with user interface to encode data. In the phase I PSI will design a special fiber laser amplifier for efficient, compact and low cost communication system. The laser will be modulated using pulse position modulation technique to encode data."

        "Abstract": "Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) will develop a compact, solid-state ultraviolet spatially offset Raman sensor with a diagnostic core retrieval system. The UV Raman sensor, currently under development at PSI, utilizes a UV laser (266 nm) that has been developed by Q-Peak (a division of PSI) for a previous NASA SBIR. The Raman sensor will also use a high throughput spatial heterodyne interferometric spectrometer (SHS). The SHS is 104 more sensitive to Raman photons than a conventional diffraction grating based slit-spectrometer operating with the same spectral resolution in the UV. In addition, the proposed UV Raman system utilizes the Rayleigh scattering law for Raman scatter at shorter wavelengths. The current UV Raman design will be modified to include a digital micromirror device (DMD) in order to collect spatially offset Raman signal (SORS) at varying penetration depths within a material. This system will be paired with a small core retrieval system in order to measure depth resolved Raman spectra within samples. This will allow for initial diagnostic testing of areas on small bodies, such as comet nuclei, to determine where larger cores should be collected and returned to Earth. Depth resolved measurements will be more indicative of volatiles trapped within the material that might vaporize off the surface during collection and avoids contamination that can occur at the surface. The Phase I effort will focus on functional testing of the SORS breadboard with the UV laser. In parallel, the Phase I will design a prototype core retrieval system, in order to better inform the final design for a Phase II prototype.nbsp;"

        "Abstract": "The hundreds of thousands oil and gas storage tanks and tank batteries at upstream production sites are inadvertent intermittent, generally unmonitored, high flow rate (flux) methane emitters. Their emission rates are poorly quantified. Flux measurements are inhibited by the difficulty of directly accessing emission sources, instrument limitations, and inability to distinguish between unintentional emission events vs routine venting. Addressing these challenges to provide the environmental benefit of reducing methane emissions demands novel cost-effective and reliable continuous quantitative methane flux measurement technology. The proposed project will validate an innovative combination of proven and emerging technologies to demonstrate the feasibility of meeting this need. The technology will provide easily installed laser-based continuous monitoring along tank battery perimeters. Configured with novel high-speed (10 Hz) measurement and spatial laser scanning, it will detect, quantify, and wirelessly report emissions. Its temporal resolution enables statistical data processing that recognizes routine vents. The laser technology is based on our transformative handheld Remote Methane Leak Detector (RMLD\u00ae) platform. In a fixed long-open-path configuration, it has continuously monitored methane emissions from storage sites for more than five years, but has not quantified flux. However, in handheld and low-flying drone-mounted configurations, the laser scanning technique yields quantitative leak plume images that provide data for deducing flux. This project will combine the techniques to demonstrate the feasibility of rapidly scanning the open-path laser beam across a \u201cflux plane\u201d to deduce plume flux at ~1 Hz with no need for plume modeling. In addition, we have acquired data illustrating the ability to differentiate between routine vents and unintended fugitive emissions. The project will demonstrate the feasibility of automating these data analytics. The ability to quantify flux of fugitive emissions and distinguish them from routine vents is a subject of intense R&amp;D. Passive infrared imagery techniques relying on thermal contrast between the methane plume and the background are currently offered for quantification, but they suffer shortcomings when thermal contrast is insufficient and they do not distinguish leaks vs vents. Our proposed active laser technique overcomes these limitations at significantly lower cost per unit. O&amp;G producers are driven by EPA regulations to begin deploying this technology in earnest c.2025 at costs"

        "Abstract": "Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI), in collaboration with Thorlabs Quantum Electronics (TQE), proposes to develop a new, state of the art, high power, high efficiency mid-wave infrared (MWIR) quantum cascade laser (QCL), emitting near 4-microns for missile simulator applications, including the Towed Optical Plume Simulator (TOPS). During the Phase I program the PSI-led team worked with Air Force customers and end-users to specify performance requirements for the proposed devices. Based on these requirements the PSI\/TQE team plans to conduct multiple rounds of wafer growth, device fabrication and testing in the Phase II program to develop improved devices that meet the performance requirements for missile simulator applications. PSI will integrate the QCLs into compact emitter assemblies and characterize their performance in the laboratory. The assemblies will then be integrated into and tested with the TOPS IR emitter system. This successful SBIR effort will result in reliable high power and high wall plug efficiency MWIR QCL devices commercially available from TQE. The proposed technology falls under the High Power, Midwave Infrared Single Device Quantum Cascade Laser Missions Focus Area."

        "Abstract": "Diode lasers now deliver very high powers at high efficiency, with ~70% electrical-to-optical conversion efficiency demonstrated by several groups from bars with powers of 100 W or greater. However, these devices are incoherent, multi-mode sources that cannot be focused effectively on a distant target and are not suitable for use as a directed energy weapon. Current directed energy designs rely on the use of \u201cbrightness converters\u201d \u2013 the light from such high efficiency diodes is used to pump another laser medium with high quality single mode output, such as rare earth doped solid-state crystals, glass fibers, and complex flowing alkali gas cells. These brightness converters add cost and complexity and sacrifice efficiency \u2013 wasting 50% or more of the injected diode laser energy by turning it into heat. The ideal situation would be to eliminate the brightness converter and use diode lasers directly. This would enable high energy laser (HEL) systems with dramatically reduced cost, size, weight, and power (C-SWAP) requirements. A significant increase in the reliable power, efficiency, and beam quality of diffraction-limited semiconductor lasers is necessary to enable HEL systems based on direct diode technology. In this effort, Freedom Photonics will design, fabricate, characterize, and deliver arrays of high power, high efficiency diffraction-limited diode lasers based on our novel tapered laser technology. These diode arrays may be used as a building block for kW-class direct diode high energy laser systems. Approved for Public Release | 22-MDA-11102 (22 Mar 22)"

        "Abstract": "Air toxics, which include a number of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), have been linked to severe health impacts ranging from asthma exacerbations to cancer and premature deaths. In many cases, emissions are localized, and are particularly of concern for communities near industrial sites (which tend to be disproportionately low-income, often with predominantly indigenous or minoritized residents). In order to identify and manage health risks from exposure to air toxics, the EPA has called for high-sensitivity, high-specificity air monitoring technologies to provide real-time, continuous measurements of VOC concentration at the neighborhood level. Freedom Photonics is proposing the development of a widely tunable diode laser source, which is a key component of an ultra-sensitive broadband near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer. To date, incorporating our tunable lasers into our commercial partner\u2019s compact, backpack?sized instrumentation has enabled sub-parts per billion detection of ethylene oxide. (The ethylene oxide instruments are currently being evaluated by the Georgia EPA in ambient monitoring applications.) The longer-wavelength tunable laser we have proposed will cover NIR absorption bands for more VOCs, and instruments incorporating multiple overlapping tunable laser sources will be capable of observing more spectral features simultaneously. Quantification of more gases in mixtures with improved specificity extends continuous monitoring capabilities to detect leaks of multiple air toxics in real time. Relative to current EPA methods for volatile toxic organic compound determination, broadband NIR spectroscopy is better suited to ambient monitoring, has a lower detection limit, and does not require sample conditioning. Most current EPA toxic organic determination methods require sample preparation in order to prevent chromatography column contamination \u2013 this precludes continuous ambient monitoring, and time consuming chromatographic separation limits sample throughput. Many compounds with similar functional groups may co-elute; fitting multiple peaks introduces more error into quantification by chromatography peak integration. Co-elution also complicates mass spectrometry interpretation, where fragmentation analysis may be needed to distinguish structural isomers. Broadband NIR spectroscopy offers complementary characterization, which can reduce uncertainty when matrix interference is problematic for present organic air toxics methods. The tunable diode laser spectroscopy market was $450M in 2019, and our capabilities with the proposed new source will expand relevance to other industries. Beyond environmental monitoring, industrial hygiene, and public health, which represent global concerns, we foresee applications in chemical process monitoring and oil\/gas pipeline monitoring, as well as medical imaging like optical coherence tomography. Our tunable lasers are also suitable for airborne LIDAR applications such as foliage mapping."

        "Abstract": "DARPA and the US Department of Defense are interested in technologies which can enable a wireless energy web comprising multiple nodes to enhance military capabilities.\u00a0 Wireless power transmission is difficult to scale to relevant powers and distances due to poor system efficiency.\u00a0 For example, as transmission distances increase there is a severe reduction in system efficiency; at distances of ~1000 m, the current state-of-the-art efficiency is limited to just ~1%.\u00a0 Optical power beaming is an excellent candidate for addressing this technology gap; however, specific challenges facing this technology include eye safety, the conversion efficiency of the transmitter, efficient transmission over long distances, and atmospheric aberrations.\u00a0 Nearly diffraction-limited high power lasers operating around 1550 nm are required to overcome these challenges, however such lasers are inherently inefficient due to the cascaded diode-pumped fiber or solid-state laser brightness conversion process.\u00a0 It would be ideal if suitably bright, efficient, and powerful diode lasers could be used directly, thus eliminating the low efficiency brightness conversion process and enabling high (~50%) efficiency.\u00a0 We propose the development of extremely high efficiency semiconductor lasers which are directly suitable for power beaming without the need for inefficient brightness conversion.\u00a0 Our highly disruptive approach seeks to demonstrate a phase-locked diffraction-limited direct diode laser array with total output power &gt;1 kW (scalable to &gt;50 kW) and wall-plug efficiency &gt;50% at an emission wavelength of 1550 nm.\u00a0"

A key technological advantage of this sensor platform is the ability to operate over an extremely wide frequency band ranging from MHz to THz by changing only the laser frequency exciting the atomic states. Modern avionics radios, such as the AN\/ARC-120, are large and power-hungry. Next generation radios can utilize an electrically small antenna via Rydberg atoms, significantly increasing EM sensitivity while drastically reducing SWaP. Rydberg type atoms are placed in high energy levels, whereby RF\/Microwave energies couple to the highly excited states and can be read out optically. High-power, low-linewidth, and quasi-tunable laser sources are required to realize such a sensor, and Freedom Photonics is well positioned to produce sources that address either Rb or Cs based Rydberg atoms."

        "Abstract": "NUBURU is proposing to adapt its innovative PrintBlueTM\u00a0- a blue laser-based 3D printing system that disrupts the way metal additive manufacturing is performed today. Today\u2019s machines use a single mode laser and a scanner to rapidly scan a small spot (40-75 um) across a powder bed. This small spot fuses the powder using the keyhole mode of welding, which is a dynamic weld puddle resulting in continuous spatter from the vaporization of the powder as well as defects throughout the part. The PrintBlueTM approach uses conduction mode welding, which has a quiescent weld puddle, resulting in minimal spatter during the powder melting process. This fusion method results in the highest density parts that can possibly be achieved without the need for sophisticated insitu feedback process monitors. Because the PrintBlueTM process is fundamentally different than any other additive manufacturing method in use today, it will disrupt the current markets and result in a rapid and substantial market adoption once introduced to the commercial markets. PrintBlueTM\u00a0uses blue laser as the printing and fusing tool. Blue wavelength have a significantly higher absorbance index in metals than the traditional IR lasers used in industry. Metal absorption of blue vs. IR is 3x higher in Aluminum, 13X in copper and 66x in gold. This allows faster printing and lower-power lasers, making the systems more efficient, cheaper and easier to use. The proposed R\/R&amp;D for the PrintBlueTM system is to construct a 3-d printer system that can demonstrate the superior performance of the PrintBlueTM technology. The printer will be a larger format than other powder bed printers available in the commercial marketplace today. The laser to be used will be a high power, 650-Watt blue laser, and the print bed will be 700 mm x 700 mm in size. There are no 3-d printers on the market today that use a blue laser system or are this size. The system is designed around a 3-axis gantry system instead of the high-speed scanners used in today\u2019s systems. Since the PrintBlueTM system prints an area approximately 4 mm x 2 mm at a time there is no need for the high-speed scanner. The highspeed scanners are what limit the addressable print volume in today\u2019s 3d printers since the f-theta lens determines the size and extent of the processing volume. By using a gantry style system, the size of the print volume is essentially limited only by the size of the gantry system used. PrintBlueTM\u00a0is at TRL 6 product demonstration stage. The 650-Watt blue laser is commercially available and deployed worldwide, making it TRL9. The motion controllers are COTS components, making them TRL9 as well. Other components - including printing head and the software - were demonstrated on a breadboard model of the system, making them TRL6."

The proposed 250 GeV center of mass\noption for the ILC, which will be used for precision study of Higgs boson, requires roughly 7,800 SRF\ncavities. Each cavity requires a minimum of 3 particle free flange assembly (PFFA) operations during the\nstring assembly, requiring skilled technicians and high labor costs.\nTechnical Approach\nThis project will develop rapid prototyping, machine vision and robotic technology to improve the clean\nassembly of a SRF cavity string. The so-called \u2018particulate free flange assembly\u2019 (PFFA) requires both\nthe manual dexterity of a skilled technician (i.e. gasket insertion) as well as extensive diligence to blow\neach bolt hole clean. This repetitive process is based on a well-defined operation sequence, and thus is\nvery well suited for robotic automation.\nPhase I Plans\nIn Phase 1, we will review current cavity string assembly challenges, tooling, workflows, space\nrequirements and equipment with engineers and technicians at JLab. We will design and 3D print a flange\nblow-off fixture, qualifying its particle shedding behavior in our class 100 clean room. We will procure\nand test a contactless, laser-based machine vision system which can locate the position and orientation of\na cavity flange. Using our Kuka robot installed on-site, we will demonstrate the ability to precisely locate\nflange holes in a known\/fixed reference frame. We will then integrate these tasks with the objective of\nautomating the ionized blow off procedure.\nCommercial Applications and Other benefits\nThe development of SRF cavities for use in particle accelerators has benefited from a close and extensive\ncollaboration between research institutions and industry. The market for medical and industrial\naccelerators currently exceeds $3.5 billion dollars a year, and it is growing at more than 10% annually.\nWhile Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) accelerators are a small fraction of the total accelerator\nmarket, there are significant demands to reduce the labor costs and improve the yield of cryomoduleinstalled\ncavities. This project will further that objective by utilizing prototyping, robotic and machine\nvision tools to automate the cryomodule assembly process. Furthermore, clean, high precision assembly\nrobots can be used for other operations, such as normal conducting cavity assembly."

        "Abstract": "STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nHigh brightness beams are needed for applications ranging from high-energy physics, and biological\nimaging such as ultrafast electron microscopy. The recent demonstration of a plasma photocathode\nshowed that high brightness beams are achievable in a plasma wakefield accelerator. However, the\npracticality of realizing the concept is challenging experimentally.\nTECHNICAL APPROACH\nIn order to employ the plasma photocathode process, we replace the plasma wakefield accelerator with a\ndielectric wakefield accelerator. This accomplishes two goals. First, the technical challenge of generating\nand maintaining a hot, dense plasma is replaced with a solid-state structure. Second, the associated\nsynchronization requirements are relaxed because a longer wavelength is used for acceleration. As a side\nbenefit, since the dielectric sustains moderate gradients compared to plasma, the respective energy spread\nof the resultant beam can be lower resulting in high six-dimensional brightness.\nPHASE I PLANS\nThe Phase I project aims to further optimize the plasma photocathode process based on lessons learned\nfrom prior experiments. Specifically, we will aim to upgrade the drive beam at the facility and employ\ntapered or pillbox-shaped structures to enhance the trapping potential, explore different laser parameters\nto optimize the ionization process, continue experimental work to optimize the drive beam parameters for\nhigh field, and conduct simulations to support the design and data analysis, in preparation for a full-scale\nexperiment.\nCOMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS\nThe program results will yield a compact package of a plasma photocathode that can be driven by\ntraditional radio-frequency based sources or novel advanced sources such as laser plasma accelerators.\nThe unit will be designed for applications that require high brightness."

        "Abstract": "Statement of the Problem\nPlasma wakefield accelerators show significant promise to shrink the size of particle accelerators and their development is well underway at DOE-funded user facilities. These ground-breaking experiments, however, are hampered by existing vacuum chamber technology. Specific issues include the large chamber weight and difficulty in quickly exchanging the chamber or its contents due to the limitations of current chamber technology.\nTechnical Approach\nThe introduction of de-constructable chambers will drastically decrease the installation weight of the chambers while the inclusion of spring-energized all-metal O-rings will increase the vacuum performance and radiation hardness of the large lids used to seal the chambers. Furthermore, will we introduce options for motorized precision alignment of multiple items from outside the vacuum envelope, include kinematic replaceable features, differential pumping, and other features uniquely required by plasma wakefield experiments.\nPhase I Results\nMotorized lids, quick-exchange flanges, kinematically-replaceable and air-side alignable in-vacuum breadboards were successfully prototyped demonstrated. These are building blocks of our modular, highly- alignable chamber concept. Prototyping of a light-weight chamber method was shown to not have positive economic benefits for other than extremely large chambers, but its technical success will be carried over to make light-weight motorized lids. In contrast, all-metal reusable O-ring seals were not demonstrated I the project timeline due to vendor constraints and integrated prototype could not be developed in time due to covid-related delays. Regardless, the Phase I work sets the bedrock for a promising new product with direct application to wakefield acceleration experiments.\nPhase II Plans\nWe will build upon the success of our Phase I prototyping to build a complete, large-scale (4\u2019 x 2\u2019) chamber with direct and immediate usefulness for FACET-II. We will incorporate demountable chamber walls that can be exchanged for different experiments, motorized lids that allow for more compact installation and fast access, complete the design of a hydrocarbon- and particulate-free hexapod for precision alignment of dielectric structures, and various other features. The chamber will be developed in consultation with UCLA and provided as a test bed for the E-321 dielectric wakefield acceleration experiment.\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits\nThis program will yield vacuum chamber system suited for accelerator experimentalists and X-ray users. This will maximize investments already made by the DOE in user facilities by increasing the \u201cbeam on time.\u201d Additionally, the vacuum chamber technology developed here offers lower base pressure and higher radiation resistance then other \u201clarge\u201d chambers and is attractive to industry as a whole. Furthermore, accessories such as air-adjustability of in-vacuum lasers and true particulate-free hexapods will find a broader market in lasers, lithography, surface science, and other ultra-clean, ultra-precise fields."

        "Abstract": "The Electron Ion Collider (EIC) injection system kickers require an extremely high peak voltage of +\/-50 kV (dual-channel) to be dissipated in a 50 Ohm impedance, corresponding to 1 kA peak current, and &lt;10 ns rise and fall times of the pulse. Existing drivers (pulsers) operate at only a few kilovolts, and most of them utilize high voltage MOSFET switches. However, MOSFETs suffer from residual resistance, which substantially limits their efficiency, and more importantly they do not demonstrate sharp enough pulse edges. Another existing approach is based on a fixed-length pulse forming network with fast ionization dynistor. It provides with good switching speed but has limitation of adjusting the pulse duration. Thus, current state-of-the-art pulsers are not applicable for the EIC kickers system and there are no reliable US- based vendors of such challenging systems. This project is developing and testing a high output pulse generator based on distributed pulser topology that utilizes novel GaN transistors as switching devices. GaN is a rapidly growing technology that enables both high peak and average power operation along with extremely short switching times of nanosecond- scale, which even creates margin on tight rise and fall times requirements for the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) kickers. In Phase I, we designed, fabricated, and tested a scalable power unit based on GaN-technology. The prototype delivers 6 kV voltage amplitude (120 A current) with 3 ns rise and fall times and demonstrates feasibility for scaling to the required 50 kV level with even shorter pulse edges than required by the EIC fast kickers systems. In the proposed Phase II project, we will fabricate a full-scale, dual-channel (positive and negative 50 kV) pulse generator, including a reliable control and monitoring system that can be integrated to the end user\u2019s infrastructure. The final deliverable of this project will be a complete prototype that is tested at the required nominal output power level and is ready for shipment to Brookhaven National Laboratory for further testing. The target segment is nuclear physics accelerator labs, as well as free electron laser and advanced light source facilities. Other applications include civil and military electronic components including radars, power conversion devices, Pockels cells drivers for lasers and high-power electro-optics, ozonators, ground penetration radars, and pulsed radiolysis."

        "Abstract": "A charged particle beam passing through an accelerating cavity excites a spectrum of resonant, higher order modes (HOM) which can negatively disrupt the beam. Suppression of HOMs represents a significant challenge for current and future accelerators, particularly high peak and\/or average current machines such as Free Electron Lasers (FEL) and Energy Recovery Linacs (ERL), which have kW- levels of estimated HOM power per cavity. While current HOM RF absorber materials have satisfied the requirements for cryogenic and room temperature operation; robust, low-cost manufacturing technologies which can generate large area RF absorbers are needed for future high current accelerators. This proposal outlines a method to fabricate novel Al\/SiC metal matrix composites for use as an RF absorber using cold spray technology. This process can be used to directly bond full density absorbers onto the inside of large, water-cooled beam line absorbers. The low temperatures associated with cold spray can result in the formation of nanostructured, non-equilibrium phases with enhanced microwave absorbing properties. We performed coupon level spray trials using 2 separate cold spray vendors, then metallographically examined the coatings. We down selected the best vendor and cold sprayed the inside of a brazed, 80 mm diameter copper vacuum assembly, followed by inspection and post-spray machining. The particulate, RF and vacuum characteristics of the assembly were measured. While we observed ceramics particles in the coating, initial 3GHz pillbox results show a metal-like coating behavior. With this proof of principle demonstration, we plan to coat the inside diameter of a large (~12\u201d) beam line absorber (BLA), such as those required for the electron storage ring (eSR) of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). In Phase II, RadiaBeam will fabricate an EIC-sized BLA copper\/stainless steel housing, performing the required dimensional and vacuum checks. In year I, we will perform coupon-level cold spray development to maximize the RF absorption of our coating. In year 2, we will cold spray the inside diameter of the EIC BLA assembly, then test the RF, particulate and vacuum properties of this full-scale device. This work is to be performed with support from Jefferson National Lab, who will provide guidance on the design, fabrication, RF measurement and data analysis. Cold spray HOM absorbers could reduce the capital and operational costs associated with superconducting RF accelerators via low-costs RF absorbers and optimized cryogenic thermal management, respectively. This novel, low-temperature powder consolidation process enables the fabrication of non-equilibrium materials which have received significant interests for corrosion and wear applications. With additional development, these composite materials can be similarly engineered to have specific RF properties. If successful, this process could also be applied to high power microwave systems and radar-absorbing aerostructure."

        "Abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) has unrivaled capability for rapid, low-cost production of parts directly from a CAD file, but is limited by microstructural defects, which could significantly degrade the structural integrity of the product. Parts for NASA safety-critical applications require 100% inspection to certify uncompromised mechanical performance. There is thus a key opportunity for in-line, in-situ, identification and correction of defects during the AM build to produce finished parts that are already fully qualified, and eliminate the need for scrapping finished defective parts.Laser ultrasonic testing (LUT) is the only currently viable method for in-line defect detection during the AM build. The IOS LUT receiver#39;s automatic compensation for optical distortion enables it to work on rough as-built surface finishes. Its noncontact nature allows it to operate on hot, moving, vibrating surfaces, while quickly moving along the surface of complex geometries. This gives close access to defects for sensitive detection, so that corrective measures can be taken, often during the following build layer, before they are covered over by further deposition. LUT thus has great potential to make AM parts more reliable and cost-efficient.Our previous work has addressed the application of LUT to detect defects in parts during AM conducted on Earth. This proposed project extends that work to AM in space, in reduced gravity.In Phase I we will produce interrupted-build samples with simulated defects on an AM machine designed for use in space, run LUT scans on them, and further develop algorithms and software to enhance defect detection and identification from the scans. We will also make preliminary assessments to show the feasibility of integrating LUT into this AM machine, of greatly reducing LUT system size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C), and of in-line correction of detected defects during a build. In Phase II we will develop and test a prototype in-line inspection system."

        "Abstract": "An increasing number of safety-critical aerospace components are being produced by additive manufacturing (AM). Specific NASA missions with AM components include the Artemis Program#39;s Orion Spacecraft and the Space Launch System. Reliable qualification of finished AM parts is needed for safety-critical aerospace applications, as only fully inspected parts can be certified for flight. In a previous NASA SBIR project, we demonstrated the feasibility of meeting this need by applying laser ultrasonic testing (LUT) for nondestructive evaluation of each AM deposited layer in real time as it is formed. This in-line inspection qualifies the part layer-by-layer, directs defect removal during the manufacturing process, and ensures qualified finished parts that require no further testing. In this project we are developing a new type of laser ultrasonic sensor that will greatly improve the state of the art in inspection performance, leading to improved suppression of mechanical and acoustical disturbances, and also enabling the implementation of a simpler and more agile beam setup and probe design. Such performance improvements will escalate the motivation for AM stakeholders to include the use of LUT in in-line inspection. The Phase II tasks are anticipated to result in enhanced signal processing algorithms and software, a more agile probe, faster adaptive crystal response, and effective integration of LUT in-line inspection into a commercial AM machine."

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in synchrotron photon sources and the introduction of the free electron laser have created x- ray sources of unprecedented brightness, coherency, and energy. These sources are at the leading edge in the quest to understand the structure and interactions of matter at atomic scales, and they are indispensables tools for science and industry. The challenge now is to transport such precise short-wavelength, \u201cdiffraction-limited\u201d, x-ray beams from the source to the experiments without distortion and dissipation. Presently the quality of the x-ray beam available to researchers is primarily limited by figure errors and surface roughness of the optics and their thin film coatings that are caused by imprecision in their fabrication (deviations from ideal surfaces). Reaching the full potential of these sources will require near perfection for the mirrors used to focus and direct the beams. Indeed, surfaces need to be smooth to the dimensions of atoms, and the required maximum allowable figure error over the entire mirror is usually less than 1 nm -- essentially a pico-scale level of precision! Nevertheless, recent advances in metrology allows such small errors to be measured and mapped, and hence these tiny errors can be corrected if a suitable tool can be developed to deterministically apply a corrective, nanoscale etch to the surface with sufficient accuracy and without introducing new errors. American Physics and Technology LLC (APT) proposes to design, develop, and demonstrate a new tool for applying precise, 3-dimensional, corrective-etches to flat and curved, meter-sized, x-ray mirrors. By iteratively measuring figure errors and correcting using our tool, we will manufacture a demonstration supermirror with the required pico-scale accuracy and smoothness. APT\u2019s approach uses two new patented surface-modification technologies based on treatment with ionized, electrostatically-accelerated beams of \u201ccluster ions\u201d. These were developed and studied in the semiconductor industry for the manufacture of next generation VLSI computer chips. The first technology, Gas Cluster Ion Beams (GCIB), bombards the surface with an intense, focused beam of nanoscale, hyper-velocity \u201cclusters\u201d of condensed gases. These Clusters are aggregations of weakly bound \u201cmonomers\u201d (atoms or molecules), typically about 10,000 monomers and approximately 4 nm in diameter. The surface is smoothed and etched by the many overlapping impacts of the clusters in the beam. The velocity and size of the clusters can be adjusted over a wide range to produce surface effects from gentle plastic deformation up to breaking chemical bonds and sputtering\/etching away the surface material. A distinctive and attractive feature of GCIB is the shallow nature of the interaction on the surface and the minimization of sub-surface damage. The second technology, Accelerated Neutral Atom Beams (ANAB), takes the cluster beam and disrupts it into a shower of individual uncharged monomers. ANAB is often used in combination with GCIB as the final step in smoothing and cleaning surfaces. ANAB gives the ultimate in uniform smoothing and etching with the minimum of subsurface damage. APT\u2019s Phase-I proposal will demonstrate our ability to accurately apply a variable dose of GCIB\/ANAB to any location of an x-ray mirror to correct the figure with sub-nanometer vertical precision. The ultimate lateral precision will depend on the size of the GCIB\/ANAB beam, the scanner-resolution, and time. Our phase-I project will demonstrate our ability to make the beams as small as 0.5 mm with the capability of varying the etch rate with sufficient accuracy and reproducibility. Advancing the state-of-the-art for x-ray optics will find wide use at the more than sixty x-ray facilities worldwide and will lead to other applications in ultra-precision fabrication."

        "Abstract": "Statement of the problem or situation that is being addressed:\nNuclear power is a key component in enabling our nation to develop and deploy clean, affordable, domestic energy sources. One of the main challenges in expanding the use of nuclear power is developing technologies which improve the reliability, sustain the safety, and extend the life of current reactors. Safe and reliable reactor operation requires knowledge of how new advanced materials will behave and age in the environment. Novel sensors capable of withstanding harsh environments are vital measurement tools for building material performance databases of novel advanced materials, enabling key information such as material displacement at high temperatures. The environments of interest for Gen IV reactors include high radiation, very-high-temperature, and chemically harsh conditions. The proposed sensor will provide material scientists an innovative advanced sensor able to withstand the extreme conditions of Gen IV reactors.\nGeneral statement of how this problem is being addressed:\nLuna is proposing to develop a compact fiber-optic multifunctional sensor that will monitor material crack growth in the harsh environments of Gen IV nuclear reactors. The novelty of this sensor lies within its capability to measure temperature and displacement simultaneously as well as being able to operate in electrically conductive environments such as liquid metal where electronic sensors are not viable. The core technology behind the sensor lies in Luna\u2019s Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) based displacement gauge and the combination of this FPI sensor with inline femtosecond laser-induced Fiber Bragg Grating sensors, both of which are radiation tolerant.\nPhase I activity:\nDuring the Phase I effort, Luna will investigate the feasibility of the approach through experimental validation to demonstrate the sensor\u2019s ability to measure temperature, and displacement simultaneously in a series of notched sample stress corrosion cracking (SCC) experiments. The sensors will be integrated into samples for Virginia Tech\u2019s SCC tester. Data will be collected and analyzed at room temperature and at temperatures up to 320?, with the sample being submerged in water and inert gas. In addition, the sensor will be immersed in molten metal to observe any damages to the sensor. Luna will also prepare plans for commercialization and Phase II testing. During Phase II, the team will target sensor operation in molten metal, molten salt, and at very-high-temperatures (750?+).\nCommercial applications and other benefits\nDue to the uniquely small form factor and ability to operate in harsh environments, Luna sees great opportunity in research markets such as nuclear reactors, oil and gas refinery operations, and solar power concentrators amongst other energy-based markets. In the nuclear market, distributed temperature and crack formation sensing in the reactor containment areas will increase efficiency and safety. Since the radiation tolerant developed sensors will also be high-temperature capable, they will also find application in rocket engine monitoring, rocket engine development, gas and coal power plants, solar salt power plants, and in gas turbine health monitoring."

        "Abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research proposal seeks to develop a laser-based diagnostic to quantify radioactive impurities present in clean materials at radiation levels &lt; 1 \u00b5Bq\/kg. The proposed diagnostic will address the need for an analytical instrument to screen clean\/radiopure for U, Th, and K incorporated into rare-event nuclear physics experiments. Existing radioassays suffer from long measurement times or matrix interference effects that limit achievable detection limits or complicate the analysis on a material-by-material basis. The overall objective of the program is to develop a laser-based magneto-optical atomic polarization spectroscopy technique that is capable of quantifying 238U, 232Th, and K in clean materials \u2013 the dominant primordial isotopes contributing to a radiation background in underground rare-event nuclear physics experiments. The primary objective of the Phase I program is to execute proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating that the proposed laser-diagnostic is sufficiently sensitive to meet the required limits of detection for these radiocontaminants. In the Phase I program a testbed will be assembled to execute proof- of-concept experiments demonstrating the sensitivity of the proposed laser-based diagnostic for 238U quantification. These experiments will provide the information required to optimize the design of a Phase II prototype instrument. A market assessment will be conducted for the technology targeting the areas of nuclear safeguards and nuclear forensics. The potential water quality monitoring market for metals of concern to public health will also be evaluated. The proposed technology can be broadly applied to monitoring soil and water for metals contamination. The technology is particularly relevant for water monitoring applications of metals such as mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium, and manganese that represent a risk to public health. The technology will have sufficient limits of detection to monitor the aforementioned elements below the maximum permissible exposure limits in real time field measurements."

        "Abstract": "Project Summary\/AbstractPhysical Sciences Inc. (PSI) is developing a sensor that can accurately measure ppbv to ~1000 ppmv concentrations of vapor phase hydrogen peroxide (VPHP). This sensor will be used for inline monitoring of VPHP concentrations of barrier isolators used for fill\/finish operations of parenteral drugs. The capability to accurately and sensitively monitor VPHP is critical, as residual concentrations as low as 30 ppbv have been shown to oxidize biologics and reduce their efficacy. The need to accurately monitor VPHP after sterilization is critical to minimize its deleterious effects on biological drug products and potentially cause shortages of high-demand biologic pharmaceuticals. In addition, batch losses due to VPHP contamination results in higher drug costs and reduced revenue. Optical sensors based on tunable laser absorption spectroscopy (TLAS) exist that can monitor VPHP concentrations with limits of detection in the ppbv range, however the TLAS approach is prone to interference from water vapor which is present at concentrations several orders of magnitude larger than the VPHP concentrations during the aeration phase of decontamination. This impairs the accuracy of existing optical-based commercial instrumentation, and makes it challenging to accurately quantify VPHP at ppbv levels. In addition, the sensors are not robust for manufacturing scale operations, requiring highly trained users and frequent recalibration. In the Phase I program, PSI demonstrated an innovative sensing approach that was capable of quantifying 38 ppbv of VPHP in the presence of 20,000 ppmv water. This approach has broad dynamic range from ppbv to 1000 ppmv \u2013 far greater than current commercial sensors, enabling monitoring of VPHP concentrations throughout the entire sterilization cycle with a single instrument. During the Phase II program, a portable prototype sensor based on the benchtop experiment will be fabricated and tested in the laboratory and in field testing on a barrier isolator and a vacuum freeze dryer. Field testing will occur at a company that builds barrier isolators for the pharmaceutical industry. Laboratory studies will demonstrate a detection of \u2264 10 ppbv in 60 seconds of averaging, and the capability to measure up to ~1000 ppmv of VPHP. Software will be developed to automate control of the sensor, enabling unattended operation \u2013 a critical element in the path towards commercialization of the technology.

        "Abstract": "Project Summary\/AbstractPhysical Sciences Inc. (PSI) is developing a head space analyzer (HSA) to accurately measure 0.01%\nof O2 in the head space of pharmaceutical vials at a speed of 600 vials per minute. The measurement\napproach is non-destructive and selectively measures only oxygen in the vial head space. HSA is used in\nthe pharmaceutical industry to evaluate the closed container integrity (CCI) of packaging against air\ningress. The presence of oxygen in the head space indicates compromised packaging of a drug product,\npotentially reducing the shelf life and efficacy and voiding the sterility. This is particularly true for biologic\ndrugs, the fastest growing pharmaceutical market segment valued at $90B\/year, that are highly susceptible\nto oxygen-induced degradation. The current standard for non-destructive HSA is based on laser\nabsorption spectroscopy. Laser-based HSA requires an active nitrogen purge to mitigate the signal\ncontribution of ~20% oxygen present in room air. The reliability of head space measurements with laser-\nbased HSA critically relies on the efficacy of a nitrogen purge. PSI&apos;s proposed HSA approach does not\nrequire a nitrogen purge removing a mode of failure, and will be an order of magnitude more sensitive than\nconventional laser-based HSAs. More sensitive detection of oxygen will lead to improved product shelf-life\nand a reduction in the shortages of biologics and other classes of drugs that are vulnerable to oxidation.During the Phase I program PSI will demonstrate the feasibility of the new HSA approach in a series of\nbenchtop experiments with standard pharmaceutical vials of different sizes. These studies will\ndemonstrate the capability of the technology to selectively quantify oxygen to 0.01% levels in the vial head\nspace with detection limits better than what are achieved with conventional laser-based HSAs. The\nexperimental studies will also demonstrate the capability of the HSA approach to be operated without an\nactive nitrogen purge. Knowledge gained from the Phase I studies will guide the development of a\nfieldable prototype design to be fabricated during the Phase II program. In the Phase I program PSI will\nestablish a collaboration with a company that manufactures and sells vial inspection instrumentation. The\nindustry collaborator will provide a location for field testing of a prototype system fabricated in the Phase II\nprogram."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in reducing environmental impact of energy generation and improving the reliability of solar energy generation. Across all market segments, solar power accounted for 36% of all new electricity-generating capacity additions in the first half of 2019. Utility-scale photovoltaic power maintained the largest share of installed capacity in the U.S. solar market but dust can affect power output. For example, the average losses due to surface contamination are about 7% in New York State, 15-25% in Arizona, and can go up to 100% during the dust storms in the Middle East and North Africa region. This project will develop a new cleaning method for solar panels.It will significantly reduce Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), prevent potable water wastage, and save lost revenue due to solar panel cleaning.This SBIR Phase I project proposes a new electrostatic method to restore the solar panel to 98% of its power capacity for a variety of soiling conditions. This technique will provide a new and efficient approach for cleaning the dust with negligible power consumption from solar panels itself without the need for an external power supply. This project integrates advances in laser-assisted manufacturing, modelling, thin-film solar panel manufacturing, photovoltaic panel testing, and large-scale installations.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Autonomous robots rely on 3D sensors to safely navigate and interact with their environment. The most reliable sensing solution is light detection and ranging (LIDAR) which uses the time-of-flight (ToF) principle to measure the distance to scene points. These long-range systems typically scan one or more lasers across the scene but the scanning is slow and although speed can be increased with more lasers, this further increases the complexity, size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) of these already expensive systems. Additionally, even high-end LIDAR sensors do not have enough spatial resolution to both detect small objects at long ranges and image a wide FoV. Alternatively, flash LIDAR uses a powerful broad flash of light to capture the scene in a single snapshot. The resulting increase in speed, however, comes at a large cost in light efficiency since the system\u2019s light power is now spread out across the entire scene. A fundamental limitation of these LIDAR systems is that they have few adjustable parameters and cannot adapt to the sensing needs of a particular situation. The proposed approach develops an adaptive ToF imaging method to provide a robust, fast, and efficient 3D sensing solution. First, it utilizes a powerful 1D scanning approach innovated by the proposing team called epipolar imaging to improve efficiency. This method sweeps a line of sensing from the rolling shutter of a 2D image sensor across the scene in sync with an aligned plane of illumination. Due to the concentration of the available light into a single line of sensing, this 1D scanning method is more efficient and provides longer ranges than global shutter systems at speeds faster than point scanning systems. To further improve the efficiency of epipolar imaging, this work will extend the approach with an adaptive illumination system that can redistribute and steer available photons along the plane to illuminate only as much of the scene that is needed. Guided by adaptive sampling algorithms developed in the proposed work, this approach will enable an even more efficient system through the dynamic allocation of light power to key areas of the scene. The proposed research and development effort first applies this method to continuous-wave time-of-flight (CW-ToF) sensors to build a high-resolution, robust, and low SWaP-C 3D sensor for mid-range applications in object detection, tracking, and recognition. Phase I research will include the development, integration, and demonstration of the high-resolution epipolar ToF imaging system with the adaptive illumination source. The base effort will first focus on hardware and system development. The following option effort will develop and demonstrate the algorithms used to adaptively sample a scene for improved object detection and tracking in a variety of real-world situations."

        "Abstract": "Raman spectroscopy has proven to be a reliable field deployable detection technique for assessing chemical threats, including chemical warfare agents, energetic materials, and illicit narcotics. Military and Homeland Security agencies commonly utilize various portable Raman systems in sensitive site exploitation, checkpoint scenarios, and to determine hazardous content on surfaces or containers. Enhanced Raman techniques, such as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) have been demonstrated to be a vibrant field of research that is growing significantly in scope and applicability while pushing at the ultimate limits of sensitivity. SERS occurs when nanometallic substrates locally amplify electromagnetic fields at or near particle surfaces providing enhancements over &apos;normal&apos; Raman spectroscopy, typically over a million-fold. Along with other advantages such as reduction of interfering fluorescence, decreased detection times, and reduction of laser power required for analysis, SERS has been positioned to be an ideal technique for low-level, low-consumable detection schemes, while aiming towards miniaturization of instrumentation. The problem to date, however, is the lack of commercially available robust SERS active substrates that have an inherent low background signature which ultimately interferes with obtaining clean SERS spectra from low-level concentrations of threat analytes, while still having at least 104 SERS enhancement. Klarite substrates with nanometer scale patterning of a silicon surface coated with gold had very low background signature and produced repeatable results. However, the Klarite substrates were very expensive and are no longer commercially available. To address the critical need, Lynntech is proposing to develop SERS substrates with nanostructured metal (gold or silver) with low background signature and with at least 104 SERS enhancement using a low-cost scalable process. The SERS substrate will be individually packaged to enable safe storage across broad range of environments."

Specifically, we emphasize that the proposed system is compact, lightweight, power efficient, and therefore can be mounted on small to mid-sized un-crewed aircraft systems. The sensor features a small (centimeter scale) exposed beam path that allows ambient air circulation without active gas sampling. The proposed sensor is based on mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy using Pendarrsquo;s proprietary distributed feedback quantum cascade laser array (QCLA) technology. Our monolithically integrated chip-scale coherent source can withstand harsh operating conditions while offering superior wavelength and intensity stability compared to other broadband mid-infrared sources. Broadband spectral coverage (up to 500 cm-1) combined with high frequency resolution (~100 MHz) enable a multi-tasking sensor capable of detecting a multitude of gases including toxic industrial chemicals, chemical warfare agents, greenhouse gases, and volatile organic compounds. The laser source can rapidly tune over a large bandwidth to provide fast spectral measurements, enabling gt;100 Hz time response. Absorption measurements in the mid-infrared fingerprinting region ensures that a small pathlength is sufficient to reach uncertainty levels of lt;1% even when operating on moving platforms. By the end of Phase I, we will have built a prototype sensor and experimentally demonstrated that the sensor can reach targeted sensitivities under simulated flight conditions."

        "Abstract": "The substopic described the need for a multi-gas sensor that is power efficient, consistent with a wearable form factor, and can reliably operate under a wide range of temperature, humidity, and pressure conditions. We propose a CO2 gas sensor that maintains the required dynamic range, accuracy, and sensitivity even under significant environmental variations. We employ distributed feedback quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) to perform intrapulse spectroscopy in the mid-infrared, which allows us to reach targeted sensitivities with ultra-low duty cycle measurements to dramatically reduces power consumption and system complexity. Pendarrsquo;s expertise in monolithic quantum cascade laser integration will enable integration of multiple quantum cascade lasers to incorporate detection of up to 5 gases, including H2O and O2, all within an anticipated system footprint of 5 cm x 5 cm x 3 cm. Phase I will focus on building a breadboard prototype to experimentally verify that 1) the system draws lt;100 mW, and 2) CO2 detection accuracy is unaffected by varying pressure and temperature. A conceptual design of the Phase II miniaturized and integrated prototype will also be proposed at the end of Phase I."

        "Abstract": "Emissions and leaks of toxic and hazardous chemicals have serious consequences to the general public and the environment. In particular, development of sensors that can continuously monitor trace chemicals associated with the handling and processing of nuclear materials will lead to timely detection of accidental leaks or prohibited clandestine activities. By extending the remote sensing range, measurements can be made at a safe distance and a large area can be effectively surveyed with one sensor. We propose a multispecies gas sensor that can operate in long-range open path configuration based on Pendar\u2019s proprietary quantum cascade laser (QCL) array technology. The sensor is capable of broadband high-resolution spectral measurements in the mid-infrared, which allows sensitive and selective detection of a multitude of chemical species. The system performs spectral measurements at a speed of a few microseconds to milliseconds, which allows timely interception of moving plumes or rapidly evolving emission sources. During Phase I, we confirmed the feasibility of a QCL array-based open-path spectrometer for kilometer- range sensing. The Phase I breadboard prototype demonstrated sensing in the spectral region of 930 cm- 1-1500 cm-1 with a frequency resolution of &lt;0.05 cm-1. Outdoor remote sensing was performed using a retroreflector with over 250-meter optical pathlength. Phase II work will focus on improving sensor stability, extending the sensing range to 1 km pathlength, and delivering a compact and fully packaged prototype that is field deployable. With Pendar\u2019s expertise in portable sensing system development, continuing funding (sequential Phase II or Phase III) will lead to further ruggedization and improvement of the mechanical and opto-mechanical design, miniaturization of electronics, and ultimately system production and commercialization. We believe the proposed system is a versatile instrument that can be applied to applications ranging from monitoring emissions in oil refineries and processing plants to trace explosive detection."

        "Abstract": "Vadum will develop Advanced EOD Aiming Technology that is precise, low-cost, compatible with one-time use devices, visible in all lighting conditions, and highly portable. Today, military EOD technicians and Law Enforcement Agency bomb squad members use several methods to aim energetic tools. For disrupters, many laser-based devices have been developed. Some laser aiming devices project a beam along the bore central axis, but must be removed before firing, risking disturbance to the point of aim. Others project a laser beam parallel to the barrel, requiring some user skill to guess the precise point of impact, which may be difficult on irregular target surfaces. Existing lasers also suffer from poor visibility in bright ambient light, and poor operation in cold temperatures. Vadum proposes an innovative approach to aiming that can be used with the vast majority of energetic EOD tools including disrupters, shaped charges, and EFPs of widely-varying sizes. The technology is adaptable to large and small EOD tools, and provides a true on-axis indication of the likely point of impact on the target. In Phase II, Vadum will continue to mature its Advanced EOD Aiming Technology for use with both manually-emplaced tools and robotically-aimed tools."

Blueshift, LLC doing business as Outward Technologies proposes to develop an in-space welding process and robotic system for on-orbit service, assembly, and manufacturing (OSAM) of habitats, space telescopes, antennas, solar array reflectors, and a wide range of potential in-space structures. The proposed process and method utilizes concentrated solar energy (CSE) as the primary power source for the welding and joining of metallic and thermoplastic components in space. Benefits of the proposed innovation include a reduction in electrical power requirements compared to current electron beam and arc welding systems designed for OSAM and further power reduction compared to laser welding systems; a lightweight deployable design that minimizes launch costs; precision spot size and energy flux controlnbsp; enabling precision welds on a wide range of materials, material thicknesses, and joint configurations; and a radiation based welding process that enables welding non-conductive materials including thermoplastics and ceramics while reducing the risk of damaging sensitive electronics that may be close to the weld. The Phase I effort will focus on defining a full-scale SO-WARM system, concept of operations for the full-scale system, and associated subsystem requirements including a well-characterized welding testbed; evaluating different solar concentrator configurations based on mass, launch volume, lifetime\/durability, and complexity; quantifying full-scale production rate and functional specifications; and demonstration of the solar welding process in an inert atmosphere through a closed-feedback-loop testbed with three aerospace materials including metals and non-metals."

        "Abstract": "Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) surgery is a type of refractive laser eye surgery used to treat nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism by reshaping the cornea. PRK surgeries are very popular among active-duty DAF personnel as they enable Airmen to safely and quickly continue performing their duties and meet vision requirements without the need of glasses or contact lenses, which can impair performance and affect mission success. After a refractive surgery, which is also frequently performed in conjunction with cataract removal surgeries, patients are required to use eyedrop medications for up to 8 weeks to prevent infection and inflammation. However, medication non-compliance can cause postoperative complications including keratitis and uveitis, which add to patient care costs, lower quality of life, and can prevent DAF personnel from returning to their duties. In response, 231 Sheep has developed the Ocuelar platform, composed of: the Ocuelar SmartCap, a battery-free capsule that attaches to standard eyedrop bottles, monitoring patients\u2019 eyedrop medication usage; the Ocuelar Patient App, a smartphone application that displays the data collected from the SmartCap and provides patients with analytics, feedback, and motivation to improve medication adherence; and Ocuelar Admin, a cloud platform for physicians, caregivers, and relatives to monitor patient adherence to medication."

        "Abstract": "Nuclear energy and weapons production historically have been a source of large-scale environmental contamination throughout the world. As a result, nuclear facilities have been found with mercury contamination on the surfaces of buildings and structures. The contaminated surfaces require careful removal as to not further spread mercury to soil and ground water, putting the health of all living beings at risk. The challenge lies in developing a technology that can noninvasively, efficiently, and inexpensively identify the surfaces containing mercury, allowing for careful removal and disposal. A mercury detection system that can easily maneuver over surfaces and sample along its path while reporting real-time analysis and contaminant location, will allow for strategic removal of contamination for proper disposal. This will minimize the rest of the demo\u2019d building materials requiring higher priced disposal as mercury contaminated. The detection system will be comprised of heated sampling heads in a variety of sizes that can be used to navigate along a surface while circumventing any obstructions and capturing mercury vapors to be analyzed in real-time. A deployment arm and portable mercury analyzer will allow for the maneuverability required for a complete survey. The data points captured from the laser mapping and mercury analyzer will later be combined with to create a 3D representation of all contaminated surfaces. Phase I will require first determining the temperature at which different surface materials need to be heated for sufficient mercury vapor sampling and the length of time in which each material requires to reach the desired temperature. Next, it is necessary to determine the optimal sample head designs needed for sampling both large (square foot) sections of surfaces as well as hard to reach surfaces. Finally, it will be important to determine the speed in which the sample head can be moved along a surface while sampling. Phase II of this project will include the construction of the sampler heads and deployment arm for easy maneuverability and safe handling. Next, a ruggedized and easily transportable mercury analyzer housing will be constructed. Finally, phase II will focus on the integration of contamination data points with laser mapping technology to ensure a 3D mapping of all mercury on surfaces. The development of a technology that allows for real-time, in-situ detection and mapping of mercury on structure surfaces allows for strategic demolition and removal, greatly reducing project timelines and disposal costs and resulting in a significant overall cost savings. As there is not currently a noninvasive technology that can both map and detect mercury contaminated surfaces on a large-scale structure, it is anticipated that more than one agency will be interested in contracting this innovation for cleanup of labs, Superfund, industrial sites, and nuclear facilities across the country."

        "Abstract": "Conventional bump bonding technique is highly limited considering the requirements of low mass and high-speed, high-density detectors for high-energy particles of the future. Reliable, readily manufacturable technologies to interconnect silicon pixel detectors with high density CMOS front-end integrated circuits are sought. Demonstrate Modified Direct Bond Interconnect technology \u2013 a cost-effective, novel choice of vertical integration method with the statistical single bump failure rate well within the specifications and that ensures longer term reliability, thermal compliancy of integrated assemblies in highly segmented, high density silicon detectors for high energy physics applications. The Phase I effort is aimed at formulating a detector-scale thermo-mechanical model of the integrated detector-readout assembly to optimize the material and geometry of each component involved in the integration as well as demonstrating the feasibility of this method by fabricating the prototype by integrating (with MoDiBI) ETROC (readout chip) and LGAD (detector chip) contributed by Fermilab and validate the approach by related charge injection, laser irradiation tests to validate the functionality at Fermilab. Modified Direct Bond Interconnect technology will find immediate application in detector chips to be used in MIP Timing Detector to be deployed as part of the CMS Upgrade at CERN. Longer term applications include full vertically integrated highly segmented, high density detectors for nuclear particle detectors, advanced infrared detector for defense and security application for active imaging systems, such as LAser Detection And Ranging (LADAR) and a wide variety of medical imaging applications such as Clinical dosimetry, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to name a few."

        "Abstract": "The fundamental challenge for a high power Faraday isolator at CO2 wavelength is the high absorption coefficient of materials with significant magneto-optic Faraday effect at the upper MID IR wavelength range. A few watts of CO2 laser beam will cause thermal runaway for Faraday isolator at room temperature. There were extensive research works on Faraday material at CO2 wavelength back in the 1970\u2019s. There have been continued efforts for developing Faraday isolator at CO2 wavelength in the following decades. No breakthrough on better Faraday material was reported. N-doped InSb is the most promising Faraday rotator material for general purpose Faraday isolators at CO2 wavelength. Free-carrier type of InSb with high doping concentration greater than 1016 cm-3 has high value of Verdet constant and is typically used for commercial MID-IR isolators. However the figure of merit of free carrier InSb at optimized doping concentration is below the minimum requirement for a Faraday rotator having less than 10% insertion loss. The only viable approach of having a Faraday isolator at CO2 wavelength compliant with the topic specifications is Interband InSb rotator of low doping centration (35dB PER, broadband ZnSe Brewster polarizer is made possible by novel polarizing coating design. Ge windows of R1.5T (15KG) uniform magnetic field in \u03d520mm cross section. Raytum Photonics will establish COMSOL model to analyze the thermal dynamics of the cryogenic rotator. We will design and demonstrate the cryogenic Faraday Isolator with the proposed innovative optical components. A 9.15\u03bcm QCL laser diode will be used to establish baseline of lower power performance and then we will collaborate with national lab for testing with high power CO2 lasers at pulsed and CW operation. During the Phase 2, we are going to deliver specs conforming units for CO2 wavelength as well as establish a manufacturing process of building the high power isolators in volume. All development work will conduct in Raytum Photonics facility. We are also going to collaborate with Brookhaven National Lab to have a preliminary test with the isolator we develop in Raytum Photonics facility."

        "Abstract": "Optical isolators provide protection of expensive\/complex lasers systems from damage due to back reflections into the laser. As lasers of ever higher powers are being deployed in applications such as laser processing, there is a need to scale the power handling of optical isolators as well. The standard geometry that is used for optical isolators consists of rods that are cooled at their cylindrical surfaces. This leads to the formation of a thermal lens and stress-induced birefringence in the media that limits the power handling of the isolator. We will use a different geometry with aggressive cooling to mitigate thermal effects. In this SBIR program, a kW-level optical isolator will be designed a prototyped suitable for an ultrafast laser system. We will also provide a path to a 100-kW optical isolator. The optical isolator that we will develop will enable higher performance in the laser processing field. Our optical isolator will provide protection again laser instabilities yielding poor machining results and laser damage eliminating the cost of replacing the laser and down time on the manufacturing floor."

        "Abstract": "Thermal conductivity of carbon fiber support structures that also serve as cooling substrates is of increasing importance for high energy physics detectors. One of the shortcomings of current carbon fiber laminates is that they exhibit excellent thermal conductivity of order several hundred W\/(m*K) along the fiber direction, whereas the through plane thermal conductivity perpendicular to the fibers is orders of magnitude lower, and at about 1 W\/(m*K) more in the range of thermal insulators. This proposal aims to significantly improve the through plane thermal conductivity, by at least a factor five, changing CFRP from being a thermal insulator to a thermal conductor in the through plane direction. Current detector support structures suffer from insufficient through plane thermal conductivity of carbon fiber laminates, leading to inefficient use of material and inferior thermal performance. High pressure cured carbon fiber laminates, laminates with laser drilled thermal vias, and high temperature post processed carbon fiber laminates developed in this SBIR will increase the thermal performance of carbon fiber laminate support structures. Gruenendahl LLC will investigate methods to for high pressure curing of carbon fiber laminates, study thermal vias in carbon fiber laminates produced by laser drilling, and develop a novel method for high temperature post processing of carbon fiber laminates. From an existing small prototype it is expected that the high pressure curing will improve through plane thermal conductivity by at least a factor of five. Commercial application is anticipated for high performance low weight support and cooling structures. Potential applications are heat shedding structures for satellites, satellite bus systems, and integrated support and cooling structures for mobile equipment in general."

        "Abstract": "Current sensors for real time measurements of ammonia in automotive exhaust are lacking in detectivity, operability, and suffer from significant cross-sensitivity with interfering exhaust species. New ammonia sensing technologies that address these shortcomings are needed to precisely control and optimize next-generation exhaust aftertreatment systems. With these high-performance ammonia sensors, exhaust aftertreatment systems can be operated more efficiently, leading to major reductions in vehicle exhaust pollution as well as an increase in fuel economy. To overcome the shortcomings of existing in-exhaust ammonia sensors, Indrio will utilize laser-absorption spectroscopy, which is a detection principle that is vastly different than existing approaches. By probing the unique molecular spectral fingerprint of ammonia, the laser-absorption spectroscopy approach is fundamentally insensitive to competing exhaust species and can achieve ammonia detectivities rivaling expensive lab-grade instruments. Additionally, Indrio will leverage its patented optical manufacturing technologies to produce sensors that rival the form-factor, durability, and cost of existing ammonia sensors. Indrio and Southwest Research Institute will construct and test a prototype LAS-based sensor instrument capable of measuring the concentration of ammonia within vehicle exhaust. Indrio will perform all of the sensor design, component manufacturing, assembly, and sub-scale testing tasks needed to assemble and validate a working sensor prototype. Southwest Research Institute will operate its advanced automotive engine exhaust testing facilities to provide a real-world test environment for assessing the performance of the Indrio-designed sensor. If successful, the sensor developed through this SBIR effort will be widely installed in vehicles equipped with next-generation exhaust aftertreatment systems, resulting in demand on the order of millions of units per year. The manpower and supply chain needed to meet this demand will have a significant positive impact on local and greater US economies. Additionally, with significantly improved ammonia sensing capabilities, vehicles will pollute less and consume less fuel, providing tangible benefits to the air quality and to vehicle operating expenses."

        "Abstract": "Optical Engines Inc will develop the required technologies and components or a monolithic fiber amplifier harness based on Ultra Large Mode Area (ULMA) gain fibers, i.e., fibers who core size is greater than 55um in diameter. These types of ULMA fibers are required for achieving multi mj per pulse operation in Chirped Pulse Fiber Amplifiers (CPA) with reduced fiber non linearities needed for low femtosecond (fs) operation and hundreds of Watts of average power. To date these ULMA fibers such as Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) Rod fibers and Chiral Coupled Core (3C) fibers have only been used in architectures where the signal and pump are coupled via free space optical means. For higher average powers, robustness, reliability, and reduced size and cost in large count parallel fiber amplifier systems, a monolithic system is absolutely necessary. ULMA type fibers are especially challenging because by their very nature they are weakly guiding and thus very sensitive to any micro bending and other stresses that might come about during the use of these fibers to create monolithic components such as combiners and mode adapters. Optical Engines has the unique capabilities and expertise to create these low stress monolithic devices for fully integrated fiber amplifier harnesses based on ULMA fibers. These laser amplifier harness components will utilize Optical Engines Patented Etched Air Taper fiber pump combiner technology, as well as our ultra-low stress fiber bundling technology. This technology has been utilized in directed energy systems with pump efficiencies of over 99% and signal efficiencies of over 96% have been demonstrated in commercially available co pumped devices; reliably operating at over 2.5kW of pump power for over 5 years. These technologies have also been combined to create low loss high beam quality combiners based on 55um core 3C passive and gain fibers. The ultra-low stress bundling technology allows for 6+1, 9+1 and even 18+1 count bundles with virtually no modal distortion of the signal beam in the ULMA fiber and efficient coupling from the gain fiber to the output fiber in a counter pumped combiner. The fiber amplifier harness will contain an input mode adapter, the ULMA gain fiber, the pump signal counter pumped combiner and a delivery fiber\/ AR coated end cap. The low stress bundling techniques and optimized Etched Air tapers and splices will also be developed. While several types of ULMA fiber exist, in this phase 1 program OEI will focus on the 85um 3C fiber as supplied by the University of Michigan and nLight. And while OEI has perfected processes for developing monolithic components based on 55um ULMA 3C fiber, the 85um core 3C fiber is expected to be much more sensitive to micro bending and much more challenging to create these components. In order to test these amplifier harnesses, Optical Engines will continue its close collaboration with Professor Almantas Galvanaskaus at the University of Michigan to develop the appropriate testing structures to create realistic test scenarios."

Multiple analytical techniques are needed to reach high certainty conclusions in a short timeframe but means of combining these techniques has heretofore been disjointed. This project seeks to develop a unified characterization approach of high sensitivity and rapidity that incorporates multiple inputs for enhanced certitude of the outcome. Steam Instruments, Inc. will develop a new class of instruments for multi-modal surface microanalysis. Optical microscopy will be enabled by an in-vacuum Schwarzschild microscope incorporated in the charged particle optics of the instrument. A novel imaging mass spectrometer will be uniquely capable of ion microscopy in stigmatic imaging mode enabled by the combination of a flat-top laser probe with a position-sensitive ion detector. The time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) analyzer will be based on a linear configuration enhanced by the patent- pending Pulsed Deflection Lens (PDL-MS) technology developed by Steam Instruments. This approach will enable very rapid acquisition ("

        "Abstract": "Fusion and high energy density physics (HED) facilities perform ultra-fast timing experiments that require good quantum efficiency (QE) in deep UV and x-ray regimes. As an example, beam timing measurements at free electron laser (FEL) facilities monitor timing for electron bunch pulses with ~ 100 kHz repetition rates in laser-driven shock, plasma, and optical\/UV pump-probe experiments. These measurements require detector rise-fall times to be below 50 ps to monitor coarse timing. Device size is another important factor, particularly in the crowded and complex target chambers of fusion facilities. The need for robust, condensed packaging, and picosecond time resolution extends to fields of laser characterization, synchrotrons, and high-speed communication. There is not currently a fast photodiode available in the market with a UV\/x- ray response time &lt; 50 ps. A photodiode based off of a metal semiconductor metal (MSM) technology will be fabricated, tuned and tested to produce &lt; 50 ps response times with high QE for ultra violet and x-ray wavelengths. The QE of the device will be tuned by researching different semiconductor materials with different dopant levels and novel electrode structures. The primary objective of the proposed program is to determine the feasibility of commercializing a tunable wavelength fast photodiode to fill the market need for improved ultra-fast detection in UV and x-ray ranges in FES applications. A study of the laboratory research and development completed to-date at a partner universities laboratory will be conducted and a plan for the development of a commercial-ready UV x-ray fast photodiode will be produced. This will include evaluation of mechanical and electrical packaging, and sensor fabrication. The company will design a packaging concept for the commercial diode based on this assessment. A robust and commercially supported fast photodiode with the current proven performance specifications will enable x-ray FEL facilities to conduct the timing measurements they need. In addition, it is anticipated that the research vein of this project will produce devices with a standard package, but interchangeable diode material that will satisfy a variety of experimental conditions (e.g. energy ranges beyond the UV into IR or x-ray regimes). These advanced features combined with the core timing, noise, and wavelength features of this device will provide the scientific community with a robust product to rely on for testing like pulse time monitoring and pump-probe experiments."

        "Abstract": "Laser-based diagnostics are a powerful tool for identifying and quantifying chemical species in the atmosphere, with applications in weapons threat detection, industrial process verification and monitoring, and climate change mitigation. The recent creation of precise, broadband laser spectrometers, such as dual frequency comb spectrometers, has opened up new possibilities in these fields, driven by advanced capabilities such as speciation of complex large molecules, simultaneous quantification of multiple species, and isotopic detection. However, in order to realize these real-world benefits, it is necessary to develop optical transceivers able to transmit broadband laser signals over long atmospheric distances with high signal to noise ratio. For an optical transceiver to achieve this goal it must simultaneously achieve efficient signal detection, with precise pointing precision to hit distant targets, and stand up to harsh weather conditions. In Phase I, LongPath\u2019s field-proven broadband transceiver design will be modified to improve the targeting precision of the transceiver by an order of magnitude. The transceiver will also implement a new signal receiving subsystem for a 3x improvement in efficiency while improving environmental robustness. These advancements will be demonstrated by using this prototype transceiver to perform sensitive, multi-species dual frequency comb detection of atmospheric trace gases over a 10 km atmospheric path, verifying the high signal to noise capabilities of the design over long distances. Expanding remote gas detection range will make this technology accessible to a number of beneficial applications. This includes the early detection and fast response to nuclear and chemical weapons manufacturing, and verification of compliance mechanisms. In the energy sector, increased-range capabilities for trace gas sensing enables cost-effective fugitive emissions detection and repair for the oil and gas industry."

        "Abstract": "Remote sensing technologies are necessary in order to increase the safety of emergency responders and give early warnings of chemical weapons attacks. The technology needs to be able to accurately identify multiple chemical species over extended ranges, even when signals are short-lived or in constant-flux. We propose to address this problem with the development of a dual-frequency comb spectroscopy based remote detection system. These systems provide a large spectral range and high resolution, allowing them to accurately identify multiple chemical species. In addition, spectral information is collected with high bandwidth, allowing for identification of chemicals within milliseconds. Our system will be enhanced with an adaptive optics module to compensate for the effects of air turbulence and allow for detection ranges much longer than one kilometer. During Phase I, we will upgrade our existing dual-frequency comb in order to allow for both combs to be phase-locked. This will increase the resolving power of the setup. Once upgraded, we will demonstrate our ability to identify multiple chemical species with high accuracy and at high bandwidth. In addition, we will demonstrate phase control of laser beams by converting a Gaussian beam into a Bessel beam with an adaptive optics module. Finally, we will determine the necessary beam control bandwidth in order to propagate the frequency comb beams as far as possible while still being able to correct for the effects of air turbulence. Our technology will have applications in detection of hazardous materials, environmental monitoring, and climate change studies, as well as applications in enforcement of international treaties pertaining to weapons of mass destruction."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a new strategy for patterning polymers on the microscale. Specifically, this project will develop a high-resolution volumetric 3D printer. This printer will generate objects in high performance materials that feature no accompanying support structures, and minimal artifacts such as layering from the printing process. This project will achieve printing at the focal point of a laser beam. Because this process has substantially reduced power requirements, printing can be achieved much faster and a a significantly reduced cost. This technology will support rapid prototyping of ultrahigh resolution parts or creation of microelectromechanical systems and will enable widespread use. This project will build a volumetric 3D printer based on photon upconversion nanocapsules. These nanocapsules contain a liquid core of molecules that undergo triplet-triplet annihilation to convert red photons to blue photons with a quadratic power dependence. When paired with an appropriate photopolymerization scheme that is activated by blue light but transparent to red light, these nanocapsules can be used to drive polymerization exclusively at the focal point of a red laser. The development of larger anti-stokes shifts for the upconversion process, and the enhancement of the upconversion efficiency will allow for rapid printing. Work optimizing upconversion wavelengths and efficiencies will be achieved using photoluminescence spectroscopy. The development of multiplexed optical schemes will further enhance the printing speed. Beam profiling will be performed to determine the success of light-shaping approaches. Functionalization of the nanocapsules will allow them to be made compatible with a broad range of 3D printing resins. Development of resins especially suited for this style of 3D printing will further differentiate this technology from existing approaches to 3D printing. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader\/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a novel on-board sensor for detecting oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in diesel exhaust streams with a sensitivity and specificity unmet by existing technologies. Diesel engine manufacturers currently cannot accurately precisely control their exhaust systems due to the lack of appropriate cost-effective sensors capable of differentiating between NOx and other species in the exhaust stream. The proposed sensor can result in 10% fuel efficiency improvements. Use of this sensor at scale will lead to reduced carbon emissions and healthier air with lower amounts of NOx-induced smog, ground-level ozone, and acid rain. The intellectual merit of this project is based on a novel application of laser-absorption spectroscopy, which probes the unique spectral absorption fingerprint of NOx species to avoid cross-species interference. This sensor is projected to achieve tenfold lower detection thresholds than current widely deployed electrochemical sensors in the harsh high-temperature particulate-laden diesel exhaust environments in a form factor similar to those of existing diesel aftertreatment systems. This Phase I research will leverage novel manufacturing techniques to fabricate and demonstrate the performance of a high-sensitivity laser-based sensor capable of surviving high-temperature, oxidizing, intensely vibrating, and particulate-laden flows characteristic of vehicle exhaust gases.

        "Abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable a critical tool for fast, high-performance measurement for precision parts manufacturing. High-precision parts are typically checked during manufacturing using fixed gauges based on 20-to-30-year-old technology costing several million dollars a year in maintenance and can take 2-3 hours using contact methods, out of a total of 20-24 hours of machine time. Improved measurements of parts in process will lead to better manufacturing practices and higher-quality parts. The proposed capability would reduce the time required for this step by a factor of 8 to 10, making in-process measurement more economically viable as well as improving machine utilization in a plant by as much as 20 percent, potentially driving savings of over $100 million per year industry-wide. The intellectual merit of this project is the development of new techniques needed to create a long-range, high-precision laser triangulation gauge usable on a wide range of surfaces. Traditional laser triangulation gauges have changed little in the past 40 years, providing a reliable but limited point or profile measurement used widely in manufacturing today. Current laser gauge range-to-resolution is around 2000 to 1, achieving perhaps 4000 to 1 in special circumstances. A range-to-resolution capability of 50,000 to 1 would greatly expand the application potential of such gauges. The proposed project reimagines the basic mechanisms in triangulation gauges to separate the measurement process from the noise inherent in laser-based systems. Rather than imaging a laser spot from the part surface, the method will use a direct angular measurement of the light. This objective will be realized by adapting phase measurement methods not used in triangulation gauges today. The anticipated result will be a gauge with micron-level resolution over distance ranges of 300 millimeters and over variations in surface finish and texture. This capability will fill a critical void in measurement tool capability for manufacturing.

        "Abstract": "Large, diffraction grade single crystal diamond plates are needed for high power synchrotron and Free- Electron Laser (FEL) sources to enable the next generation of x-ray sources and experimentation. The current materials used cannot handle the heat loads and radiation intensity anticipated. Currently, there are no manufacturers of such material in the US. We propose the growth of high-quality single-crystal diamonds in the laboratory by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The CVD technique does not suffer by the size limitations of other synthesis methods and can produce material with the highest purity, thermal conductivity, and radiation hardness available. Euclid Techlabs has designed a growth strategy to produce diffraction grade diamond plates with the desired material properties. In Phase 1, we have developed strategies for growing high quality, low strain, and dislocation material, which eventually can scale to larger sizes than diamond materials produced by other methods. Due to covid-19, single crystal diamond seed plates with significant areas (&gt; 10 mm2) free of bulk defects arrived too late to properly prepare the surfaces, a critical part of the strategy. We were able to grow ca. 0.6 to 0.9 mm of epitaxial diamond on two initial plates (but not optimized to our strategy). Assessment of the quality of the epitaxial layers grown demonstrated areas as large as 1 mm2 with a very low strain-induced birefringence caused by defects implying low or no dislocations which is supported initial x-ray topography images. These results imply that we will be able to produce diffraction grade diamond by CVD.In Phase II, we will build our custom CVD reactor facility, acquire, and prepare appropriate diamond seed plates. Once the facility is operational, we will implement our growth strategy developed in Phase I for defect-free epitaxial CVD diamond single growth. To assist the development of the growth strategy, we will perform optical polarimetry, x-ray topography, x-ray rocking curve measurement, optical surface profilometry, photoluminescence, and other diagnostics as needed and appropriate. Finally, we will design and test preliminary prototype x-ray optical elements for commercialization. Enabling X-ray sources&apos; high brightness will allow a new generation of measurements that could have a revolutionary impact across a broad area of science, including biology, medicine, cancer treatment, and quantum information."

        "Abstract": "EPIR Inc. proposes the implementation of a nondestructive characterization system for twodimensional mapping measurements of minority carrier lifetime in silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, and other semiconductor materials used in high energy physics detectors. The system can accurately map the minority carrier lifetime in 6 inch high purity germanium wafers used in CCD applications and GaAs materials used for scintillation applications. Since these semiconductor devices are extremely sensitive to the contamination that can lead to charge trapping and dark current generation sites, minority carrier lifetime mapping measurements can provide a rapid technique to quantify the quality of the semiconductor substrates, for characterizing initial material quality as well as the impact of processing on the material properties. The minority carrier mapping system developed by EPIR utilizes an optical pumpprobe design. A fast pulse laser with wavelength longer than the bandgap of the material under test serves as excitation source and a long wavelengthinfrared LWIR light beam serves as a probe. The lasergenerated excess carriers lead to increased free carrier absorption related to the excess carrier concentration. Free carrier absorption decay is detected using fast LWIR HgCdTe detectors, specially designed and fabricated at EPIR during Phase 1. The carrier recombination lifetime is extracted based on established material and device physics models. During Phase 1, we finalized the system design, initiated overall system integration and performed preliminary minority lifetime measurements. The measured lifetime values are in good agreement with the ones obtained using the photoconductive decay method. During Phase II, all pumping and probing photons will be delivered and collected using optical fibers. Optical couplers will be employed to ensure flexibility, stability, userfriendliness, and maintenancefree operation. Highspeed analog to digital convertor boards will be used to digitalize the timedependent signal for lifetime extraction. Furthermore, we will fully enable the system\u2019s automatic measurement capability and we will conduct mapping measurements using our two dimensional scanner built in Phase I. This will allow mapping and scanning measurements on areas up to 15 inch \u00d7 16 inch, sufficient for any large area semiconductor wafers. The system will be capable of accommodating four 6 inch or 150mmdiameter wafers in a single run. With further maturation of the technology, our proposed system can also be integrated with other semiconductor material evaluation or device fabrication lines, including the ones used for radiation\/infrared detectors and light emission devices."

        "Abstract": "Round REBCO wires with excellent tolerance to bend strain have been demonstrated. A 1.3 mm diameter round REBCO wire reached an engineering current density of 586 A\/mm2 at 4.2 K in a background field of 20 T at a bend radius of 15 mm. This performance meets a key design requirement of Canted Cos \u03b8 CCT coils being developed for future accelerator magnets. The main roadblock to the utilization of round REBCO wire in accelerator magnets is its cost. The primary objective of this project is to reduce the cost of round REBCO wires by fivefold while maintaining the same critical current Ic at 4.2 K, 20 T. The fivefold cost reduction is being achieved by: 3fold reduction using onethird the number of higher Ic REBCO tapes which reduces both raw material and fabrication costs, 1.4x reduction by increasing manufacturing throughput and 1.2x reduction by increasing manufacturing yield. In our Phase I project, we have successfully met all these goals. Using an advanced metal organic chemical vapor deposition MOCVD process, we have fabricated 10meterlong tapes with Ic over 3000 A\/12 mm at 4.2 K, 20 T which is 3x Ic of commercial REBCO tapes. We have increased the throughput of our manufacturing process by multiple improvements: 30x increase in tape slitting goal was 3x, 4x increase in the silver sputter deposition goal was 3x, and 4x increase in copper stabilizer electroplating goal was 3x, and a ~3x increase in thin substrate fabrication using a new process this was a stretch goal for 2x. The better laser slitting technology also results in a better quality of tape edges which improves the manufacturing yield. In Phase 2, we will scale up all these enhanced technologies to produce 30+ m long round REBCO wires at 5x lower cost. The Advanced MOCVD process, and highthroughput substrate fabrication, slitting, silver and copper deposition methods will all be scaled up to produce 50+ m long, symmetric REBCO tapes with 3x the Ic of commercial tapes. These tapes will used to fabricate 30+ m long round REBCO wires. Samples of lowcost wires will be provided to our national laboratory collaborators for coil winding and testing. In addition to meeting the needs of High Energy Accelerators that would operate at 20 T and beyond for High Energy Physics, the new technology would be highly impactful in the commercial market for accelerators which includes proton beam therapy in medicine, ion implantation for digital electronics, for safer use of nuclear energy, treatment of water and flue gases, pharmaceutical drug development and nuclear forensics and cargo screening for security. Additionally, our round REBCO wires can enable commercialization of HTS in power applications such as generators, motors, and transformers."

        "Abstract": "In this project, we seek to advance highintensity laser technology relevant to laser plasma acceleration, other highenergy physics applications, and applications in lightsource technology relevant to DOE. KMLabs has specialized in the development of high average power laser systems with pulse duration in the fewoptical cycle regime, near the fundamental limits of pulse duration. However, LPA requires high peakpower laser pulses\u2014lasers that have in the past only operated at very low pulse repetition rates. Our goal is to develop a kHz repetitionrate laser with unprecedented high peak power. We plan to build a single tabletop laser with 510 TW peak power, operating at 1 kHz repetitionrate, and capable of accelerating electrons to relativistic energies of ~25100 MeV. This project will thus provide an unprecedented platform for implementing laserplasma acceleration on a relatively small scale, and with a laser that operates stably at repetition rates that allow for precision studies of the LPA process. It also ideal for applications, for example for studies of dynamics in radiation chemistry. In phase I of this project, we investigated the thermal management and optical considerations necessary to produce multiTW pulses with our kHz ultrafast lasers. We identified parameters within the laser amplifier crystal and thermal management that, upon optimization, will allow higher pump powers and thus higherenergy amplified pulses. We directly measured the thermal conductivity of several key materials at the cryogenic temperatures used in these high average power lasers, but where there was no preexisting data in the literature. These findings provide guidance for building a laser amplifier capable of generating ultrafast pulses with 100200 mJ energy and 100200W average power\u2014a new milestone in ultrafast laser performance. Importantly, we will achieve this performance while maintaining the exceptional beam quality necessary for LPA and other highfield applications such as high harmonic generation. In subsequent phases, we will add a booster to the amplifier, following closely the Phase II design principles to substantially increase the output power achievable in a tabletopscale laser system. Our goal is 100150 mJ pulse energy, with &gt;5 TW peak power in 15 20 femtosecond pulses, and &gt;100W average power. This work will notonly provide an unprecedented technology demonstration key to many DOE goals including LPA, but will also also bolster the technical specifications of all our commercial laser systems. For example, our XUUS EUV will produce much higher photon fluxes when pumped by a more powerful amplifier. This will make the product attractive to markets such as semiconductor lithography and metrology, that require brighter and shorterwavelength light sources. Thus, advances made possible by this SBIR will dramatically strengthen our ability to serve these and other important markets."

        "Abstract": "The high electrical and thermal conductivities of copper make it ideal for plasma facing components such as heat sinks and waveguides. To improve plasma performance and steady state tokamak operation, one path is off-axis current drive for current profile control. Radiofrequency (RF) power is among the leading contenders, but the harsh environment poses significant challenges. An innovative solution to this complex problem is to launch the lower hybrid waves from the high-field-side instead of the low-field-side of the tokamak. This relocation is predicted to dramatically improve wave penetration, current drive efficiency, and launcher robustness in a reactor environment. For efficient current drive, transmission losses must be minimized. Presently, first wall temperatures may be as high as 800\u00b0C, where copper is a poor structural material. Recent development of a copper alloy, GRCop, provides a potential solution with near copper like electrical and thermal conductivities with significantly improved strength at elevated temperatures. However, components produced from GRCop must be made using powder metallurgy techniques. Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques based on laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) have recently been used to produce GRCop components, but component size is limited. The development of AM techniques that can produce meter long GRCop waveguides would be extremely beneficial. Therefore, blown powder techniques based on High Pressure Cold Spray (HPCS), which can produce components 2m in length and greater, are being developed to produce meter size GRCop waveguides. During Phase I, HPCS processing parameters have been developed that enable the deposition of dense GRCop with properties equivalent or exceeding GRCop produced with other manufacturing techniques. For example, testing has shown HPCS GRCop has conductivity values ~80% of pure copper, which is ~15% greater than the conductivity of L-PBF GRCop. In addition, the ability to produce complex shaped components such as hexagonal and rectangular cross-sectional tubing, which is needed for advanced waveguides has been demonstrated. Profilometer measurements have shown the internal surface finish of HPCS-AM GRCop is ~3\u03bcm Ra on unpolished mandrels, which is a 3-4 times improvement in the surface finish as compared to L-PBF GRCop. To demonstrate proof-of-concept, subscale GRCop waveguide cavities were produced using HPCSAM and delivered to MIT for testing. Preliminary results have shown HPCS GRCop cavities in the as-deposited condition have equivalent Q factor to L-PBF GRCop cavities that have had their interior surface abrasively polished. During Phase II, the techniques will be optimized to produce full-size prototype waveguides, i.e., ~1m length, with as-fabricated surface finishes less than 1\u03bcm Ra to improve performance. Tests of these advanced waveguides will then be performed at MIT to yield critical RF data. The additive manufacturing techniques developed during this effort will be applicable to copper and copper alloys as well as other ductile materials for producing large free form components with improved surface finishes for government and commercial applications. These include aerospace, defense, propulsion, power generation, medical, electronic, and corrosion protection coatings."

        "Abstract": "ASC has developed the Global Shutter Flash LiDAR (GSFL) technology that is ideal as a navigation and hazard avoidance sensor for fast traversing robots and rovers. The GSFL provides real time 3D imaging by capturing a full frame of 128 X 128 pixels per laser flash. With a frame rate of 30 frames per second, the GSFL provides an organized 3D point cloud which translates into non distorted 3D real time video. Scanning LiDARs and stereo vision systems cannot compete with this technology. The GSFL can image through dust that may be encountered on planetary surfaces where a scanning LiDAR and stereo vision systems cannot. The GSFL can operate in direct sunlight and total darkness including the roverrsquo;s shadow. Stereo vision systems cannot operate in either lighting environment. The GSFL has no moving parts which allows the system to have minimal Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) and has a much higher reliability than a scanning LiDAR. ASC has designed and delivered the GSFL technology for terrestrial applications and space for both radiation tolerant and radiation hard environments. ASC has the expertise in house to design, develop, and deliver GSFL hardware including application specific algorithms to support fast traversing rovers and robots. For this SBIR phase I, ASC will work with NASA and develop the mission requirements and CONOPS for the robot or rover. From the CONOPs, ASC will derive the system requirements and system architecture by utilizing tools including the link budget and z-max for the optical design. A concept design will be completed in phase I. This will include the hardware design including the optics and also the software architecture and algorithm selection. For phase II, ASC will demonstrate the technology using a robot with a GSFL and a simulated planetary field with rocks as hazards. The robot will demonstrate navigation and hazard avoidance in the simulated field."

Aberrations are controlled by selective use of refractive surfaces in combination with reflective ones to achieve a low dispersion (but correctible), athermalized, flight hardened, high-power ready optical system with looser alignment tolerances and more precisely manufacturable components.nbsp;"

        "Abstract": "Reversible adhesives arenbsp;an attractive option for assembly and disassembly of reconfigurable space structures due to the simplicity of the fastening concept. This enables space frame construction concepts where the unit members would quickly bond at the joints. Additionally, persistent asset structures that allow temporary or permanent rigid mechanical attachment at an arbitrary point on their surface at any time may enhance their long term utility. These would allow additional components to be held fast on the exterior surface of the deployed craft without the need for pre-built attachment points. A convenient method for producing this result would be an adhesive that could bond these structures following arbitrary lengths of time while in LEO, lunar, or deep space environments. ATSP Innovations has developed such a reversible adhesive concept based on solid state bond exchange reactions between polymeric interfaces composed of a novel thermoset resin system called aromatic thermosetting copolyester (ATSP). This concept has been successfully demonstrated on Earth including in radiation environments. ATSP Innovations proposes development of a flight package for a MISSE-FF experiment berth to validate these properties. A compact package that would be exposed to LEO would be designed and fabricated with exposed surfaces of the reversible adhesive for future testing on return to Earth. Prior to flight, mechanical, morphological, and chemical state of samples would be assessed via nanoindentation, 3D laser-based profilometry, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to determine upon return other notable changes in the samples. This project would be the validation of the first polymeric structural adhesive concept usable in a space environment.nbsp;This concept is potentially usable in any position in the solar system where the temperature is less than 300 deg;C.nbsp;"

        "Abstract": "The proposed graphene-based electrode materials for electrodynamic dust screens provides a unique approach to deposit both the conductive material and a high dielectric constant insulator in a single wet coating method. The laser reduction of graphene oxide will provide electrodes with improved electrical conductivity over current state of the art, while the non-reduced graphene oxide composite will demonstrate an improved dielectric constant and higher breakdown voltage. The resulting EDS array will exhibit higher flexibility than current ITO alternatives and will be processable on complex or highly curved surfaces. The proposed work will build on WattGlassrsquo;s existing knowledge base of liquid deposition of thin-film coatings at an industrial scale and our ongoing efforts to utilize graphene oxide to provide static-dissipative coatings for passive dust mitigation. Additionally, this work will utilize WattGlassrsquo;s developed capabilities to simulate lunar soiling and dust removal in a vacuum environment that includes UV and electron bombardment. At the end of the Phase I, a TRL of 4 is expected with the lab scale validation of an EDS electrode array. This will prepare for the anticipated Phase II research effort, where the electrode material will be further optimized, incorporated into an existing EDS prototype, and improved dust clearing will be demonstrated in one of NASArsquo;s lunar or Martian environmental test chambers. A TRL of 6 is expected at the conclusion of Phase II."

        "Abstract": "The proposed Multi-angle Phase Matrix Polarimeter (MP2) will be the first field-worthy and aircraft-adaptable instrument for in situ measurements of the aerosol scattering phase matrix that allow for characterization of aerosol physical and optical properties. These measurements can lead to inference of aerosol type with a temporal resolution of minutes.nbsp;The MP2 follows from a history of polar nephelometers that illuminate suspended aerosol particles in a chamber and then measure the scattered light as a function of angle. With the MP2 we intend to modulate polarization at the source and then measure not the intensity but the polarization signal at the detector.nbsp; This can provide measures of six elements of the scattering phase matrix, at multiple scattering angles. Previous polar nephelometer technology has stopped halfway, modulating polarization at the light source, but then only measuring intensity at the detector. Thus, existing technology has achieved measurements of only two phase matrix elements (P11 and P12). The six phase matrix elements will contain unprecedented information about aerosol properties that can be retrieved from inversion software.nbsp;Furthermore, the MP2 is designed to be modular with possible connection to an inlet with an aerodynamic sizer. This allows size selection, such as PM2.5, before characterization of the phase matrix. Multiple stacked MP2s, allow for phase matrix measurements for multiple particle size categories.nbsp;There are two possible options to achieve the MP2.nbsp; Option (a) uses multiple light sources (LEDs) and a single polarimeter detector.nbsp; Option (b) uses a single light source (multi-wavelength laser) and multiple fiber detectors. Each option can achieve the technical objectives. The technical proposed work is to build a tabletop demonstration of both options and then evaluate the best option for Phase II.nbsp; Options will be evaluated as to technical feasibility, sensitivity, portability, durability and marketability."

        "Abstract": "LIDAR detectors are essential for both the spaceborne and airborne systems in many NASA missions. Detectors working at 1064nm wavelength are particularly important to work with YAG-based lasers, the main light source in operation. Therefore, NASA has identified the need of a 1064nm detector with enhanced photon detection efficiency (PDE), low dark noise, and low excess noise.To achieve the goal, Imaging Nanosystems proposes a device that employs the Cycling Excitation Process (CEP), a highly efficient carrier multiplication process to amplify the photocurrent. The device combines (i) a thin layer of disorder material as the CEP gain medium deposited directly on (ii) an InGaAsP light absorption layer, and (iii) using a conduction band offset epitaxial stack to produce the properties of self-quenching and self-recovering, thus saving the need for active quenching circuits.In this Phase I program, we will design a single photon detector based on the analysis of the absorption layer combined with the CEP gain medium by 1D and 2D simulations. The 1D simulation would complete the device structure with all layers, and the 2D analysis would consider the mesa height, field distribution, gain uniformity, and any field-crowding effect which may introduce early breakdown and gain nonuniformity. Additionally, a simple prototype device, integrating the gain medium layer with the light absorption layer, will be designed, fabricated and characterized to demonstrate single photon detection capability and low dark count rate."

        "Abstract": "Advanced systems for wind sampling and measurement are a prime area for technical innovation. Applications range from atmospheric and climate modeling to aerospace vehicle design. Systems with higher temporal resolution and fidelity offer the ability to record increasingly transient atmospheric phenomena, leading to improved feedback for atmospheric modeling and for real-time adaptive systems for flight dynamics and wind power generation systems.Systems amp; Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC) proposes a Multi-Channel Long-Range Wind LIDAR system toward increasing the scan rate, and therefore the temporal resolution, of advanced Wind LIDAR systems. The proposed system scales up from an already-developed single-channel fiber optic based, eye-safe wind LIDAR, initially designed for UAV systems and brought to breadboard level through Army and NASA programs. The single-channel transceiver consists of a narrow band laser seed, acousto-optic modulator for frequency shift and pulse forming, a three-stage erbium-doped fiber amplifier, and a coherent receiver, all operating at an eye-safe wavelength of 1550 nm. The system electronics and computational stack are in PCIe\/104 format, allowing miniaturized light-weight packaging suitable for small UAV applications and the entire range of commercial and military aircraft. This LIDAR allows air current Doppler detection beyond 3 km. The Wind Measurement LIDAR was originally designed to detect energy sources such as vertical uplifts, wind direction, wind gradients and transient gusts for optimal path determination for energy conservation in UAVs. By further developing the capabilities of this wind LIDAR system, specifically by increasing the channel count up to a targeted 32 channels, the overall system scan rate can be increased proportionately thereby improving the temporal resolution by up to 32x. Lockheed Martin Space and Rotary amp; Mission Systems divisions have provided a letter of support for this LIDAR program."

        "Abstract": "There is a growing need to accurately characterize nuclear materials not only for nuclear safeguards and nonproliferation treaty verification but also for forensics and provenance. Presently, nuclear material identification requires samples to be collected and sent to laboratories for analysis using large and expensive equipment, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers (ICP-MS) or secondary-ion mass spectrometers (SIMS). This can take weeks to obtain results, and utmost care must be taken to ensure the integrity of the sample. Optical techniques, such as laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and tunable diode laser absorption (TDLAS), show potential as viable field detectors for nuclear materials. However, field LIBS instruments suffer from poor spectral resolution to detect isotopic shifts of nuclear materials while TDLAS lack broad spectral coverage for multi-species detection. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lab-based high precision broadband dual comb spectrometer (DCS) can detect multi-element and multi-isotope detection and characterization of materials for nuclear forensics. In recent work we have demonstrated the feasibility of this DFC approach by identifying and resolving isotopic and ground state hyperfine splittings in rubidium following a single laser ablation shot, as well as identification of multiple species simultaneously utilizing the inherently broad optical bandwidth of the DCS. In this Phase I effort, we will demonstrate the feasibility of a broadband titanium:sapphire femtosecond DFC as a novel spectrometer operating at high repetition rates to enable fast analysis of materials containing trace elements and their isotopes for nuclear forensic applications. This will lead to the development of a prototype instrument in Phase II. The proposed technology using a broadband dual frequency comb source for high precision absorption spectroscopy can be used to identify, characterize and analyze various materials for elemental composition and isotopic analysis in real-time. Our technology will also be much more compact than mass spectrometer, allowing our technology to be more suitable for field applications and in challenging environments. The proposed technology will also benefit the analytical chemistry community and pharmaceutical industry where the spectrometer can be applied to high precision spectroscopy to identify various chemical compounds."

        "Abstract": "The hand held Wheel Inspector provides the capability to measure wheel profiles, create wheel rim surface models, identify and classify defects using combined surface and image intensity data.The device uses a camera and two laser profilometers to recover the wheel profile to an accuracy of 0.00012 inches; an ultrasonic sensor provides the wheel back-to-back measurement.The device supports two modes of inspection: 1)A Snap shot mode enabling manual inspection at any accessible point on the wheel&apos;s circumference, 2)An Area of Interest Automated Survey mode which recovers a surface model of an accessible extent of the wheel&apos;s circumference under user supervision.The wheel profile data is processed to recover rim and tread inspection measures. The wheel&apos;s outer face surface model is created using an ensemble of profiles collected in the automated survey mode.A surface model is then compared to a 1:20 taper surface, the resulting surface difference model is then combined with its associated intensity image map; the combined data is used to localize defects in the surface, classify them and quantify their severity. The device features: 1) A Microsoft Surface Duo touch screen user interface, 2)A 24VDC Lithium Ion battery providing 2.2 hours of operation."

        "Abstract": "The Air Force utilizes yttrium aluminum garnet\u00a0(YAG) laser crystals for critical applications including target designation, range finding, guidance, and directed energy weaponry; but has identified that thin film antireflection coatings on the laser facets reduce the laser-induced damage threshold (LiDT) of the crystal and are a primary limiting factor in achieving desired power levels. The Air Force recognizes that these coatings can by be replaced with an antireflective nano-texture that is etched directly into the critical laser facet, providing a rugged, low absorption solution with superior optical performance and laser damage resistance.\u00a0 In the Phase II effort, YAG crystals will be nano-textured and characterized; showing bandwidth, reflection level, and angular and polarization insensitivity properties that far exceed the capabilities of coatings. Absorption measurements on the etched surfaces will confirm the absence of the absorptive defects that are seen in thin film coatings and lead to premature laser damage. Standardized pulsed and CW laser damage testing will demonstrate that the damage threshold of nanotextured YAG surfaces greatly exceeds the thresholds of military specification antireflection coatings for YAG.\u00a0 Beyond the performance and durability metrics of nano-textures, improved cleaning and integration processes are required to increase product yield and drive down cost in laser manufacturing. This program will work closely with our commercial Phase II partners to simplify and streamline the methods of integrating nano-textured surfaces into thin disk and slab YAG lasers. Comprehensive analysis of laser function and stability will verify that antireflective nano-textures provide improved beam quality and stability, and provide significantly improved power handling. This Phase II effort demonstrating a reproducible and cost-effective manufacturing process for integrating nano-textures with YAG, is a critical milestone on the path to providing the U.S. Department of Defense with an industry base for providing critical nanotextured infrared materials, and a path to advancing power scaling in high energy lasers.\u00a0"

        "Abstract": "Emerging Unmanned Air Systems (UASs) are challenging current surface-to-air and air-to-air missile seeker capabilities. They are highly maneuverable and can sustain accelerations of 20 \u2018Gs\u2019 or more. Many are low observable and have active decoys as well as countermeasures (e.g., Russian Sukhoi S-70 and Chinese CH-7). The UAS flight envelopes can approach the performance of missiles so that there is less room for error in seeker performance. Swarms of UASs can overwhelm a defense system, especially when they are used in combination with decoys. Recently, the U.K. Royal AF demonstrated an autonomous swarm of unmanned aircraft with BriteCloud expendable active decoys. Also, AFRL is developing the Golden Horde Swarm program. For air-to-surface munitions, seekers face challenges that are just as imposing as swarms.\u00a0 Seekers must maintain accuracy with Camouflage, Concealment and Deception (CCD) used to mask targets as well as a complicated environment due to clutter and confusers in the scene. Robust Automated Target Recognition (ATR) is essential for identifying friend vs. foe and a prerequisite for precision strikes against tactical targets. Missile seekers using mmW radar (including multi-mode seekers) need improved signal processing capabilities to retain lethality against these new threats. We have outlined a processing approach that will drastically improve both the accuracy of airborne target identification and target lock in the presence of decoys and countermeasures. In addition, this approach can improve ATR using multi-sensor input for ground targets. We propose a solution for a low cost \u201ccommon\u201d multi-mode seeker that uses Open System Architecture (OSA) for use on the future Global Precision Attack Weapon (GPAW). The GPAW system will have a multi-mode seeker that utilizes GPS, UHF datalink, and laser designator to maneuver to the approximate location of the target. In this program, we address the performance of the seeker by employing a novel approach for processing of the mmW inputs. Our proposed solution is designed to reduce seeker and weapon cost by streamlining the software development and enabling dynamic, real-time laboratory testing of representative scenarios. ISL\u2019s innovative solution directly supports the National Defense Strategy by providing \u201c\u2026Joint Lethality in Contested Environments.\u201d In addition, it addresses the Air Superiority 2030 Flight Plan \u201c\u2026mix of capabilities to penetrate the highly contested environment as well as deliver effects from stand-off ranges offers a balanced approach to counter the A2\/AD strategy.\u201d"

        "Abstract": "Since the development of efficient factoring of large numbers, quantum information processing has gained widespread interest, driving the need to realize a quantum computer. The use of tapped ions has proved over the years to be one of the most successful way of deterministically creating entangled states for manipulating, characterizing and using these states for measurement. Desirable for these systems is the ability to have a collection of quantum systems that can individually manipulate their entangled states, and their coherences maintained for long durations while suppressing the effects of unwanted couplings to the environment.\u00a0 Among the path to develop these systems is the Pauli trap containment with a time sequenced laser cooling applied to the trapped ion and independently measuring the decay from hyperfine doublets defining states |0&gt;, and |1&gt;. Digibeam is presenting a unique slow wave structure with ultra-fine granularity control of electric fields, coupled with high optical access and compact in size called the Compact Room Temperature Ion Quantum Trap or (CRQT). The system features high density self-aligned laser cool and sensing, capable of independently adjusting trap channels for long linear ion chains beyond 20 trap, cool and sense channels per single ion chain."

        "Abstract": "Thrupore is a specialty manufacturer of carbon-based catalysts which combine porosities of up to 80% with an industry-leading crush strength of 5.4 lbs\/mm versus 2.8 lbs\/mm for the closest competitor, resulting in a light-weight (0.28 g\/mL versus 0.52 mg\/mL for competitors), yet strong carbon compound. Thrupore carbon is commercially used as a delivery vehicle for other catalysts, whereas its special properties allow for a much lower loading of expensive catalysts (often precious metals) compared to competitors\u2019 products. In many applications, Thrupore\u2019s carbon compound even served as an effective catalyst on its own, with significant cost- and environmental benefits compared to the prior situation. Thrupore carbon is the first compound of its kind with adjustable precursor rheology, which allows forming of the precursor into a wide range of shapes. The manufacturing process for the precursor is proprietary and patented to Thrupore and is routinely applied to synthesize carbon beads within tight size and form factor constraints according to specifications imposed by Thrupore\u2019s present customers in the chemical- and textile industries. The powder synthesis process can be readily generalized to a wide range of additive manufacturing modalities: the carbon precursor can be deposited as a paste or deposited in an inkjet (\u201c3D printing\u201d) process, and subsequently treated thermally or through laser sintering. An obvious Air Force application would thus be the Air Force\u2019s Research Lab\u2019s efforts to create higher-temperature polymer composites using 3D printing with carbon filaments added to polymer resin, with Thrupore Carbon\u2019s light weight and flexible rheology the most attractive features. Thrupore\u2019s carbon manufacturing process is continuous, which reduces waste inherent in competitors\u2019 batch processes and allows for a wide range of recycling of carbon compounds. The latter is in line with the Air Force Rapid Sustainment Office\u2019s mission to find lower-cost and more sustainable processes for additive manufacturing. A related additive manufacturing application for Thrupore\u2019s catalysts is a new coating technology using resol-formaldehyde polymers developed by Thrupore. With catalytic enhancement, curing of protective coatings using that process has been shown to accelerate by two orders of magnitude, from 12 hours to 7 minutes for one application. Since the method can be used to adjust the roughness and adhesive wettability of many surfaces, it can help the Air Force Research Lab\u2019s Munitions Directorate find improved ways to bond additively manufactured parts with dissimilar materials."

        "Abstract": "As many countries turn their focus back to the Moon to establish a sustained lunar presence, robust, reliable communication from the lunar surface to Earth will become critical. To enable the long-term success of a permanent lunar presence, communication systems should be able to adapt to the environment and threats by deploying and maintaining themselves. Such a system\u2019s utility will additionally depend on its ability to inform end users and fill their essential needs, such as position navigation, timing services (PNT), and enhanced domain awareness, and to do so consistently and constantly. To meet this need Lunar Outpost proposes LEAP or the Laser Extended Ad-Hoc Prescence to provide communication between the Earth and Moon, and across the lunar surface. LEAP\u2019s hardware is designed to thrive in the lunar environment and offers network capabilities for the foreseeable future once it has been deployed. LEAP\u2019s core system is Lunar Outpost\u2019s HL-MAPP rover, a 220kg mobility platform that can support up to 80kg in payloads. This rover, properly equipped, serves as the communications link between the Earth and Moon by supporting an ultra-long-range laser communication system that is capable of communicating with any appropriately equipped system on Earth or in Earth orbit. Lunar surface communications are enabled using deployable network relay nodes that are dispensed by the HL-MAPP rover. These nodes utilize cutting edge mesh networking protocols that enable them to daisy chain connectivity to across the lunar surface and beyond the range of conventional networks. The mesh capabilities of these nodes ensure that communications with lunar surface assets are robust and redundant by offering multiple pathways for communication. Beyond this the LEAP system is dynamic and mobile, meaning network coverage can be changed depending on the mission and it is capable of evading threats."

        "Abstract": "The elimination of fasteners to join two composite components together and reliance on adhesive bonds in a bonded structure is an important factor in the design and development of adhesively bonded composite structures for the Air Forces\u2019 next generation of fighter and bomber.\u00a0 Minimizing or eliminating fasteners is also important in the of repair of adhesively bonded metal-to-metal aircraft structures at the depots as part of a sustainment operation to extend the operational life of aircraft.\u00a0 Present process control to repair these structures emphasizes surface preparation as the primary means of controlling quality and bond strength. To date, ultrasonic and thermographic inspection is the only means, aside from visual inspection, that is used to judge the quality of adhesively bonded structures and bond repairs.\u00a0 The current nondestructive inspection techniques involving ultrasonic inspection are not capable of determining bond strength for certification of bonded structures, limiting bonded joint acceptance for critical structures. Laser Bond Inspection (LBI) offers a method to characterize adhesive bond strength that are absent from traditional NDT techniques (Ultrasonic Inspection).\u00a0 The LBI method has been matured for evaluating the composite-to-composite adhesive bonds. \u00a0LBI can be also used to validate the integrity of adhesive bonds during the repair process by identifying weak bonded repairs and to detect the presence of \u201ckissing bonds.\u201d\u00a0 The implementation of the LBI method is to verify the adhesive bonding process is under control and the bond meets the intended design requirements.\u00a0 Laser Bond Inspection (LBI) will benefit the repair process by verifying the repair strength, ensuring aircraft safety and minimize rework of metal-to-metal bonds. This SBIR Phase I proposal is focused on demonstrating LBI can be used to characterize metal-to-metal bonds by detecting the characteristics of the returning stress wave as is currently done with composite-to-composite bonds. The investments made by Industry and Government to generate data and build the various LBI system components to conduct this inspection process can be leveraged to support this proposed Phase I for maturation and implementation for the inspection of bonded repairs.\u00a0 LBI can be used to validate the integrity of repairs that are made to either a metallic or composite aircraft by identifying weak bonded repairs and to detect the presence of \u201ckissing bonds.\u201d"

        "Abstract": "Rare earth metals are mission critical to securing US national security and ensuring the US Air Force has the tools and technology to keep the nation safe. Neodymium is critical for permanent magnets used in electric vehicle motors and missile guidance systems. Europium is used to develop the next generation of laser weapons technology. Praseodymium is crucial to new satellite communication and weapons technology. Currently, the US gets 91% of its rare earth elements from China as there is no domestic supply chain. Rare earths are produced in a 4 step process; mining, concentration, separation, and metalization. In recent years, there has been downstream development in mining and concentration of rare earths, but this concentrate must still be processed in China. Phoenix Tailings is the only US company with the technology to take rare earth concentrate from mining waste and other sources, and process it into the final metal needed for technology development. By developing this technology, Phoenix Tailings will ensure a stable supply of the materials needed to develop next generation combat vehicles, missile defense systems, and communication networks."

        "Abstract": "Global Technology Enterprises is developing a low thermal resistance laser diode sub-mount, utilizing our commercial CuD, high thermal conductivity spreader material based on a copper matrix with diamond particle additions.\u00a0 The CuD will be custom processed and finished for laser sub-mount applications which requires development of an ultra sharp edge on the CuD for diode mounting in addition to ultra high Thermal Conductivity up to 2X higher than copper. GTE will collaborate with a leader in the field of Diode laser applications both defense and commercial to develop Air Force applications. These processing steps will uniquely define the defense application of CuD as an advancement over conventional use of CuD as a heat spreader. By repurposing CuD in laser diode sub-mounts and overcoming the technical issues associated with that task,\u00a0\u00a0 we can significantly improve the thermal management of laser diode assemblies. The improvement in thermal management of laser diode heat loads will result in laser Diode Pump Modules that can operate at higher temperatures, higher output power, and \/ or at higher electrical to optical efficiency. The innovations that GTE is developing will improve laser diode performance for both Air Force applications as well as for commercial applications. An improvement in laser diode performance and operating efficiency will enhance the performance of diode pumped fiber laser systems used for Air Force Directed Energy and other applications."

        "Abstract": "Resident space objects (RSO) are a serious threat to US space assets. Space laser ranging is one of the promising long range RSO detection modalities. Of particular interest is global shutter flash LIDAR (gsf-LIDAR) technology because of its ability to detect and measure the relative speed and location of an object. Existing gsf-LIDAR systems are limited detection ranges of 10km. Simulations have shown that the range performance can be extended to 50km using the existing LIDAR InGaAs APD detector technology. Two emerging APD technologies, AlInAsSb and HgCdTe have significantly improved gain and excess noise factor performance compared to InGaAs. These technologies can potentially extend the gsf-LIDAR range performance beyond 100km. The goal of this program is to perform gsf-LIDAR RSO range detection simulations using published AlInAsSb and HgCdTe detector parameters."

        "Abstract": "Most nanofabrication techniques currently rely on 2D and 2.5D patterning strategies. Over the past two decades, direct laser writing methods have allowed for the single-step fabrication of self-supporting, polymeric 3D nanostructures; however, many nanostructures, such as GRIN lenses, waveguides, or resonators arranged in discontinuous 3D patterns, are not possible. This raised the need to develop a versatile 3D nanofabrication strategy that allows independent control over the geometry, feature size, and chemical composition of the final material. To address this need, we invented \u2018Implosion Fabrication\u2019 (ImpFab), a fundamentally new technology enabling scalable, multimaterial, 3D nanofabrication in any geometry. We propose to design and develop a broadband, fully-3D, gradient refractive index (GRIN) Luneburg lens-based NMBS that can achieve a near 2p steradian FoR with near diffraction-limited resolution and no off-axis aberrations while also meeting other requirements for size, power, beam quality, aperture, and P2P steering speed. Irradiant Technologies is uniquely able to develop this MWIR NMBS solution through our revolutionary 3D nanofabrication platform: Implosion Fabrication, which enables scalable, multi-material, 3D nanofabrication in any geometry."

        "Abstract": "We propose developing new instrumentation based on swept-wavelength external cavity quantum cascade lasers (swept-ECQCLs), to acquire physical\/chemical data on chemical weapon agent (CWA) and simulant properties in laboratory-scale explosive testing, and to improve\/validate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. In Phase I, we demonstrated laboratory measurements of CWA simulant combustion using a swept-ECQCL to measure broadband infrared transmission\/absorption spectra through explosive fireballs at a 400 Hz rate and determine fireball temperature and species concentrations versus time. Aerosolized CWA simulants DIMP and TEP were measured and identified unambiguously based on their absorption spectra, and decomposition products ethene and propene were quantified for different explosive test configurations. For Phase II, Opticslah LLC proposes developing the swept-ECQCL instrumentation and analysis algorithms into a hardened prototype, performing extensive laboratory-scale high-explosive testing of the system, and comparing measurements with CFD simulation outputs. The swept-ECQCL instrumentation will provide a versatile diagnostic for high-speed in-situ sensing of CWA simulants in explosive fireballs for immediate applications in CWA-defeat and validation of CFD codes, and future standoff detection with larger-scale explosive testing. The technology will be viable for high-speed chemical sensing applications in additional defense\/commercial markets to detect toxic chemicals, perform combustion\/engine diagnostics, monitor industrial processes, and more."

This electromagnetic plasma separation is combined with the RF field to induce a Ponderomotive effect, which further enhances antenna effectiveness by clearing out electrons in front of the antenna.\u00a0 The Phase I program will be supported by the Texas A&amp;M hypersonic engineering team under direction of Dr. Tichenor, who will perform both hypersonic electromagnetics and Computational Fluid Dynamics modeling and analysis in support of the system design. This modeling and analysis effort by Texas A&amp;M will be conducted in conjunction with finite element RF modeling of the plasma, vehicle surface and antenna, which will be performed by SPEC\u2019s RF engineering staff.\u00a0 The separation of the plasma for the small GPS antenna is relatively straight forward, while the high gain antenna necessary for satellite communications is more challenging.\u00a0 Current drones use large 24 to 30 inch high gain Ku band antennas, which cannot be used on hypersonic vehicles.\u00a0 Instead, our proposed baseline antenna design uses a phased array composed of transmit and receive patch elements separated into rows along the outside of the vehicles body.\u00a0 In this concept the plasma electrons are forced into \u201crivulets\u201d with low electron concentrations along the antenna rows interspersed by rows of high electron\/ion concentration.\u00a0 The DC magnetic field and RF clearing field then form a resonate structure in the plasma, which is maintained along the flow direction length of the antenna. During the program, the laser cooling arc plasma (LCAP) effect will also be explored as an adjunct effect."

Directed Energy Test (DET) supports testing of high-energy systems. Test ranges require accurate information regarding atmospheric conditions to evaluate DET results, including ambient light extinction (causes attenuation in the atmosphere). Our existing commercial technology is well suited to this problem, in that it provides highly accurate, sensitive measurements of true ambient light extinction and particle size distributions in a robust package suitable for outdoor operation on test ranges. It can also be reduced to a form factor suitable for UAS and other airborne deployments and is low enough in cost to provide a full three dimensional picture of atmospheric conditions in a test range and along the test system energy path. Our team of atmospheric physicists and optics experts are well positioned to transition the technology to DOD applications, and broader commercialization. Our proposal addresses TA-003 Directed Energy Technology and TA-005 Sensors Technology."

        "Abstract": "Metal additive manufacturing (AM) has long struggled with reliability and quality control due in part to the prevalence of part defects. Addiguru proposes to develop and validate an intelligent system which\u00a0 Combines\u00a0in-situ\u00a0(real-time) monitoring with artificial intelligence (AI) based software to detect defects Provide feedback to Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) systems that will correct defects during the build proces This, in turn,\u00a0will create a\u00a0closed-loop or self-healing system. The closed-loop system can reduce defect rate by as much as 40% which is observed\u00a0in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) manufacturing process. An optical camera will capture images of each layer which will then be processed by the deep\u00a0learning software to detect and characterize defects. The enhanced\u00a0software will identify\u00a0updated 3D printing (AM) parameters for future layers.\u00a0These updated\u00a0parameters\u00a0in upcoming layers will be communicated\u00a0back to the 3D printing (AM) machine in order to repair or significantly reduce identified defects, as well as prevent future defects. Phase I will focus conducting product-market fit as well as technical\u00a0feasibility of the solution.\u00a0???????Technical\u00a0feasibility of closed-loop solution will include\u00a0enhancing\u00a0the capability of Addiguru&apos;s currently commercialized software, and then validating the closed-loop solution\u00a0along with\u00a0EWI&apos;s existing Open Architecture LPBF system.\u00a0The\u00a0focus will be\u00a0on defect detection and correction of those defects in real time."

        "Abstract": "Presently, heavy-ion radiation testing of electronics relies on bringing samples to large particle accelerator facilities. To reduce the size of a heavy-ion accelerator and to bring the accelerator to the end users, we turn our attention to lasers. Short-pulse (fs) lasers capable of high powers and high intensities are useful for the generation and acceleration of ions. The interaction of an intense laser pulse with a dense target can generate short (~ps) collimated ion beams with energies up to GeV range and high repetition rates as well as extremely high beam intensities and ion fluencies. Such ion pulses are difficult to attain with conventional radio-frequency accelerators. Here we will explore several laser-driven ion generation and acceleration schemes and trade these against the available real estate gradient. Our objective is to develop a pathway to a brand-new ion source and a brand-new accelerator that are specifically designed for high-energy, heavy-ion beam testing of electronics bound for space applications. We will explore an ion source and a conventional accelerator as well as a pure laser-driven source and accelerator. The goal is to produce a range of ions to at least 100 MeV\/n for testing Single Event Effects (SEE). Approved for Public Release |21-MDA-10789 (21 Apr 21)"

        "Abstract": "Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCLs) are one of the most versatile sources of radiation in the mid-infrared range and have found applications in a variety of fields. Despite their widespread adoption, one of the main hurdles holding QCLs back from large volume manufacturing is the large cost of ownership. While QCLs, like most semiconductor devices based on III-V compounds, can leverage the economies of scale typical of semiconductor manufacturing, and therefore lower production cost at wafer and chip level, it is at the testing and packaging stages of QCL production that most of the cost can build up and not scale as easily in large volumes. One of the most time-consuming steps during the post-fabrication testing and packaging process is device burn-in. Burn-in generally consists in running the devices in controlled conditions deemed representative of the actual operating specs in the field for a number of hours. This is done in order to screen out possible early degradation issues that may lead to costly device replacement after system installation is complete. Notwithstanding the importance of this issue, up till now there are no recognized industry standards for device burn-in qualification procedures and there are no proven models for laser degradation to support such procedures. Optimizing early screening of defective devices by improved burn-in procedures is likely going to reduce post-fabrication costs (testing, packaging, installation, etc.) which in large volume manufacturing typically represent the largest portion of production costs. A long burn-in procedure (i.e. 100hrs or more) can help reduce the rate of rejection of QCLs from ~20% straight out of the wafer to less than 2% when delivered to the customer, so a 10-fold reduction in returned product costs both for the manufacturer and for the final user. This result though, comes at the cost of a very time-consuming procedure that cannot easily be scaled up to large volumes without increasing the cost of capital equipment and production logistics. Reducing the burn-in time to a few hours, or maybe even minutes, at least for the devices most likely to fail, will unlock a great cost reduction for the manufacturer that can be passed on to the final user. The key to realizing such a dedicated burn-in procedure lays in the following main steps: Understand the failure mechanisms of high power QCLs (device degradation models) Enhance burn-in stressors that map the failure modes specific to QCLs (\u201caccelerated\u201d burn-in) Identify key screening parameters leading to early signs of degradation (\u201cquick rejection\u201d tests) In this way we can not only build a more effective burn-in procedure that can reduce the rejection rate of finished products, but we will also be able to reject defective devices earlier in the process and therefore reduce the costs associated with testing time and facilities."

        "Abstract": "Innosek has teamed up with The University at Buffalo, to research the feasibility of using additive manufacturing to create lightweight aircraft components made of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). The University at Buffalo had previously been developing a method to treat UHMWPE, making it 14x stronger and 8x less dense than carbon steel. They will further their research by adapting the polymer for use in structural components, and testing functionality over a broad temperature range, mimicking the temperatures of aircraft operating conditions. Innosek will seek Air Force stakeholders for a successful STTR Phase II Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), as well as test the feasibility of 3D printing UHMWPE. Prior studies have shown that additive manufacturing of UHMWPE is possible, but optimization features must be implemented. Innosek aims to create an enhanced thermally controlled environment within a selective laser sintering (SLS) instrument to commercialize additive manufacturing of UHMWPE. Anticipated benefits are the development of lightweight structural eVTOL components manufactured at lower cost, provide lower cost per mile, and with better protection against physical threats. Potential commercial applications range from automotive structural components to sports protective equipment and additively manufactured custom orthopedic implants."

        "Abstract": "Precision optics for high-power X-ray sources are required to propel a wide range of quantum and materials science investigations in support of new technology development and biomedical research. They are challenging to make and US technology currently lags behind international competitors. What is needed is improved methodology to measure the optical surface during the manufacturing process. The new approach to in-process mirror metrology combines measurements using smart fiducials in overlapping sub-apertures defined by a pseudo-random pattern. Separately, a deflectometry system looking at the mirror surface at an oblique angle provides a \u201cframework\u201d at mid to high spatial frequencies on which the interferometry data, at higher resolution and higher precision, may be hung. A newly developed method will precisely stitch together the measurements. A second new method will remove the instrument transfer function from the data to further enhance the measurement accuracy. In Phase I, the method will be demonstrated using an existing interferometer on mirror samples of order 100-200 mm. In parallel, the software tools will be developed to implement the fusion of interferometer and deflectometer data, sub-aperture stitching, and removal of the instrument transfer function. An intuitive and interactive user interface will be developed to display the surface maps, compute statistical metrics, and show synthetic X-ray images for a given beam profile computed from the measured mirror surface. The new technology will enable the commercial manufacture of grazing incidence X-ray mirrors of superior quality. The immediate applications of these mirrors are in high-power X-ray laser beam lines, where they will enable higher power density on the target. In turn, this will support a broad range of research efforts including, for example, elucidation of protein and macromolecular crystal structure on ever smaller scales, investigation of materials properties in the development of quantum computing hardware, and time-resolved structural and dynamic behavior of polymeric compounds of interest in advanced manufacturing processes such as 3D printing. Beyond X-ray systems, the new metrology tools will also serve to improve the quality of optics used in semiconductor lithography machines that use extreme ultraviolet light. These engines write the microscopic electronic components on silicon integrated circuits that are ubiquitous in computers and smart systems the world over. Moving further down the electromagnetic spectrum, the technology will also reduce the fabrication time for precision mirrors at visible wavelengths, used in optical systems from astronomical telescopes to space-based sensors, because of the wide dynamic range of the method compared to existing tools. This allows precise measurements of surface figuring requirements to be made during the manufacturing process which may then be completed in fewer steps."

        "Abstract": "Ultrafast lasers have moved from laboratory instruments only available in a few laboratories worldwide to ubiquitous tools both in research laboratory and in industry. In particular, ultrafast lasers have become the cornerstone to drive secondary sources of coherent X-rays and ultrafast electrons. These secondary sources \u2013 in particular coherent X-rays \u2013 find applications as crucial as the inspection of photolithography masks in the semi-conductor industry. In this project, we propose to develop a reliable method to combine multiple high-power lasers, providing a pathway toward ultrashort, high-energy and high average power lasers. A prerequisite to widely deploy ultrafast lasers in industrial settings is to reliably scale the average power and pulse energy of these systems, a challenging task that has so far eluded the laser development community. In this work, we have started to tackle this problem. The community has identified that the path to scale ultrafast lasers to high energy and average power is via multiplexing and combining of multiple amplifiers. The combination techniques that have been employed to date put stringent requirements on each of the high-power amplifier to be combined, making beam combination exponentially challenging as the number of amplifiers increases. In this project, we propose to use parametric chirped pulse amplification of multiple pump beams and a single signal beam, enabling the combination of multiple energy\/average power limited amplifiers into a single beam. In Phase I, we demonstrated and numerically simulated the combination of two 1 \uf06dm wavelength beams into a single 1.5 \uf06dm wavelength beam with &gt; 100 \uf06dJ of energy and a spectrum supporting &lt; 100 fs pulses. The experiment was performed at 1 kHz. In parallel, we investigated the development of high average power fiber amplifiers to the few tens of Watt level. The aim of this part of the work was to determine suitable parameters, engineering choices and architecture to later develop an all integrated, parallelized set of rod-type fiber amplifiers that would individually operate in the average power and energy limited regime and be combined into a single beam via optical parametric beam combination. These investigations have allowed us to develop a blueprint for a multi-channel amplifier and allowed us to establish contact with relevant manufacturers in the field for future collaborations. In Phase II, we therefore propose to (i) develop a two-color front-end system that will deliver ~30 W average power at repetition rate \u22641 MHz at 1 \uf06dm wavelength and nJ, 100 MHz, 1.5 \uf06dm wavelength pulses with a spectrum supporting &lt; 100 fs pulses; (ii) scale the 1 \uf06dm pulses from the front-end from the 30 W level to the 400 W level in a set of 4-parallel rod-type fiber amplifiers; (iii) perform R&amp;D to optimize the parametric combination efficiency and reliability and (iv) demonstrate combination of the four, hundred W level channels into a single 1.5 \uf06dm wavelength beam via parametric beam combination. This system will be used to develop a commercial secondary source of coherent soft X-ray making it the first, commercially available, high flux, half-keV coherent photon source."

        "Abstract": "Many energy conversion and transfer processes critically depend on the material nanostructure details and its response to external excitation fields. Surface and volume defect formation and migration in conjunc- tion with carrier transport processes have a profound impact on the opto-electro-thermo-mechanical prop- erties of materials. Understanding these phenomena requires a unique combination of advanced atomic- scale imaging with controlled nanoscale excitation and quantitative probing of fundamental processes. The proposed innovation is focused on a method for simultaneous nanoscale multimodal imaging of en- ergy conversion\/transfer processes by integrating tip-based pulsed laser radiation sources within a trans- mission electron microscope (TEM). Nanoscale confinement of radiation fields of enhanced intensity un- derneath a tip-based probe enables unambiguous and direct in-situ interrogation of the nanostructural ef- fects on the material properties. In this project, an apparatus combining nanoscale laser excitation and optical signal collection of photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), ultrafast optical probing and Raman spectra will be designed, tested and integrated into a TEM holder. In Phase I, tapered fiber and near field probe tips have been employed for excitation of the optical response of the specimen with nanoscale spatial resolution. Custom miniature optics for efficient signal collection and a benchtop prototype apparatus has been designed and constructed, which enabled far-field and near-field PL spectroscopy while meeting the requirements for implementation into the TEM instrumentation.Based on this work, Phase II project is proposed to construct and test an integrated TEM holder for in-situ multimodal optical spectroscopy and validate its performance via detailed ex-situ TEM experiments and analytical diagnostics. Furthermore, the prototype will be tested in the real scientific studies, for example, in-situ characterization of defects in the synthesis of nanostructures. The outcome of this project will enable a widespread adoption of unique facility for the in situ direct cor- relation of optical spectroscopy with atomic level imaging. This entirely new capability will undoubtedly have a profound impact to the fields of Materials Science and Manufacturing. The users of the proposed approach can embark on a host of fundamental studies on the true nanoscale interaction of photons with materials that are impossible to conduct by the presently available instrumentation. For instance, the in- situ laser probe will give a user a front row seat to examining fundamental features of energy conversion and transfer processes"

        "Abstract": "There is a critical need to accurately monitor the buildup of various fluoride and chloride salts as well as critical states of uranium present in molten salt reactors to prevent corrosion that would not only reduce the efficiency of power generation but also endanger operation safety of the facility. Online monitoring is, thus, needed for key salt parameters and the level of dissolved alloy constituents to implement corrosion control technologies to ensure that the reactor is operating within safety limits. To overcome these technical challenges, we propose using a broadband dual frequency comb source to characterize fuel materials. To do this, a small sample of the fuel material will be ionized into a plasma by an intense laser pulse. The plasma is then probed by dual frequency comb to provide the characteristic absorption spectrum for different fuel materials over a broad spectral range. Because this is an optical technique, where no sample handling is required since the plasma can be generated at a safe distance away by the laser, any radiation hazard, specifically from nuclear materials can be minimized. The proposed technology using a broadband dual frequency comb source for high precision absorption spectroscopy can be used to identify, characterize and analyze various materials for elemental composition and isotopic analysis in real-time. This may an alternative to conventional mass spectrometry where sample handling and analysis can take up to a few weeks long. Our technology will also be much more compact than mass spectrometer, allowing our technology to be more suitable for field applications and in challenging environments."

        "Abstract": "Significant advances have been made for additive manufacturing (AM) of both thermoplastics and optically cured thermosets. AM of thermally cured thermosets has lagged behind. Materials that belong to this thermally cured class of thermosets, such as silicone rubbers and polyurethanes, are not well represented in the AM space, despite their widespread use in medical, military, and other arenas. There is a clear need to develop a practical and commercially viable means for AM of thermally cured thermosets. Ideally, this solution would enable AM of current commercially viable thermally cured thermosets with a speed that is comparable to those already realized for thermoplastics and optically cured thermosets. Realizing this goal will provide several benefits, including: Parts built from thermally cured thermosets with designs that cannot be achieved via casting\/molding. Iteration of part designs without having to invest the time and funds in new molds. Medical and military devices and personal protection equipment (PPE), custom-fit to the end-user. Ability to print multifunctional composite materials, with a soft inner layer and a harder outer layer. Rapid production capability for DoD personnel when deployed overseas at forward locations. Simplification of supply chains, as stocks of different parts is replaced by a single raw material. \u00a0 This project will develop a printer capable of printing composites of commercially available thermally cured PDMS, directly yielding a cured final part. This work will be accomplished by a team of three organizations, Actuated Medical, Actinic, and the Lear Research Group at the Pennsylvania State University. Actuated Medical has significant engineering, 3D printing, and commercialization experience, while Actinic and the Lear Research Group have already constructed a primitive working PDMS printer, upon which this work builds. Using the photothermal effect of gold nanoparticles, the Lear Laboratory attained extremely rapid temperature cycling rates, moving from room temperature to 1000 K in 8 ns. Both the rate and the final temperature are many orders of magnitude greater than what is required to meet the technical challenge outlined above. The Lear Research Group has also demonstrated the chemical relevance of this heat, which provides up to a one billion (109) fold enhancement to the rate of polyurethane, epoxy, and silicone curing, suggesting that photothermal curing can be used to bring rapid (less than 1 ms), on-demand curing to a wide range of thermally cured thermoset polymers using a range of photothermal composite materials (carbon fiber, ceramics, graphene, metals, and metal oxides). Importantly, the physical and mechanical properties of materials that were photothermal cured were controllable and similar to those attained using bulk-scale heat (ovens) to cure. The photothermal approach to curing will enable AM of commercial PDMS."

Data analytics will provide dimensional data sufficient for determining deflections at every line-scan frame with sub-centimeter resolution. The color line scan cameras have a maximum sample rate of 13,000 lines\/second with image file sizes on the order of 0.5 MB, enabling all image processing to be near real-time. We anticipate this technology being available within three years through licensing with commercially available equipment and proprietary software. Current methods for performing this type of engineering analysis require laser profilometry equipment, which is much more expensive than line scan cameras, requires huge amounts of data to be collected on road, and requires data to be processed off site after completion of testing.\u00a0 The innovation for this project will be providing real-time analytics giving the customer information to make rapid determinations of surface conditions at a significant reduction in the overall system cost compared to current commercially available systems."

It will have a small thermal mass and exhibit laser-like input-output characteristics, i.e. \u201cPlanck laser\u201d. We will provide a theoretical framework for our PC-filament that breaks the traditional reciprocity of absorption and emission. We will develop and model a theoretical basis for our approach to the active modulation of the intensity of thermal emission. For directional switching, our approach uses electro-optical modulation to dynamically change the wave-front of the radiation. A theoretical model to predict the active steering of PC thermal emission will be developed."

        "Abstract": "The elimination of fasteners to join two composite components together and reliance on adhesive bonds in a bonded structures is becoming an important factor in the design and development of adhesively bonded composite structures for the Air Forces\u2019 next generation of fighter and bomber.\u00a0 It is also an important factor in the application of composite patch repairs at the depots as part of a sustainment operation to extend the operational life of aircraft.\u00a0 Present process control emphasizes surface preparation as the primary means of controlling quality and bond strength.\u00a0 To date, thermographic inspection is the only means, aside from visual inspection, that is used to judge the quality of adhesively bonded structures and repair patch installations. Laser Bond Inspection (LBI) offers new opportunities for the characterization of adhesive bond strength that are absent from traditional NDT techniques (Ultrasonic Inspection). \u00a0LBI can be used to validate the integrity of adhesive bonds during the manufacturing process by identifying weak bonded repairs and to detect the presence of \u201ckissing bonds.\u201d\u00a0 The implementation of the LBI method is to verify the adhesive bonding process is under control during manufacturing and the bond meets the intended design requirements.\u00a0 The current LBI inspection head available for the LBI system can inspect confined and easily accessible bonded structures such as wing skins bonded to a spar or stringer.\u00a0 The objective is to design an inspection head that can be used to conduct inspection in confined locations.\u00a0 The size of the inspection head is partially dictated by the detection instrument that is built into it to detect and record the characteristics of the returning stress wave. This SBIR Phase I proposal is focused on demonstrating a new detection instrument to detect the characteristics of the returning stress wave to replace the existing instrument that is large and bulky Photo Doppler Velocimeter to support the LBI tools an inspection head concept that is capable of inspecting bond joints during initial manufacturing and to support current and future depot level sustainment The investments made by Industry and Government to generate data and build the various LBI system components to conduct this inspection process will be leveraged to support this proposed Phase I for maturation and implementation for the inspection of bonded composite to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new detection instrument.\u00a0"

        "Abstract": "The goal of this effort is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel propellentless propulsion concept based on the theory of quantized inertia, called the Horizon Drive. \u00a0\u00a0 Efficient propulsion without propellant has long been a goal for scientists and engineers grappling with the rocket equation. Attempting to achieve high delta-V capability\u00a0demands rocket engine exhaust velocities (i.e. specific impulse) that have yet to be achieved while maintaining reasonable thrust levels.\u00a0Over the last decade, Prof Mike McCulloch (Co-I) has developed a new theory with important implications to propellentless propulsion which describes inertia based on Casimir-like interactions with the surrounding vacuum. This theory calculates inertia based on an imbalance between Unruh radiation from the Cosmic and Rindler Horizon, leading to the possibility of designing an asymmetric optical cavity that produce a net force when electromagnetic energy is applied. Such a device offers\u00a0high thrust efficiency\u00a0(&gt;100mN\/kW) while not requiring stored fuel, allowing for incredible enhancements to satellite maneuverability and lifetime. Propulsion without propellant has been demonstrated in space by solar sails and laser propelled micro-sails and are being pursued as a method to send ~gram sized payloads to interstellar distances. Unfortunately,\u00a0propulsion based on momentum exchange with photons is fundamentally limited to a thrust efficiency of ~mN\/MW, and\u00a0these methods are not well suited to Commercial and Defense applications with scientific\/sensor payloads. Building on Prof McCulloch\u2019s DARPA Phase I\/II Program that investigated the scientific and theoretical underpinnings of Quantized Inertia \u2013 a propulsion system based on this revolutionary physics would outperform current state-of-the-art by factor of 1,000 and enable completely new missions and maneuvering capabilities. The Phase I STTR work will study the feasibility and utility of a Horizon Drive powered 3U Cubesat, and determine the most suitable DoD customer, with the goal of building a protype in Phase II, followed by an in-orbit demonstration of the engine."

        "Abstract": "Scaling of high-performance, many-core computing systems calls for radical approaches to provide ultra-energy-efficient and high-bandwidth-density interconnects at very low cost. Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) a promising solution because of its low latency, ultra-fast switching speed, high density, and relatively low energy consumption. State of art of the high-speed VCSEL can provide 50 Gbps with 100-200 fJ\/bit. According to William Holt, head of Intel\u2019s Technology and Manufacturing Group, all optical components after 2021 must require a power consumption of &lt; 10 fJ\/bit. A key component required for low power; dense interconnects is a high-speed, integrated modulator with small footprint to a VCSEL. Here a novel modulator array monolithically integrated with a 980 nm VCSEL so called transverse coupled cavity is proposed by Dr. Dalir from Optelligence LLC and Prof. Sorger from the George Washington University (University partner) to enrich the light-matter interaction in quantum wells (QWS). In phase 1, 980nm coupled cavity devices will be thoroughly investigated and integration with the driver IC under development for verification of functionality will be considered.\u00a0 VCSEL and PIN arrays shall be coupled to the modules using ribbon wire bonding to simplify package development.\u00a0 Table optics can be used to for initial characterization to eliminate the need for custom molded optics at this stage.\u00a0 If operational, the module will be coupled one channel at a time and characterized for link budget, BER, optical eye opening, and energy per bit. In phase 2, bottom emitting coupled cavity 980nm VCSEL arrays with micro lensed output will be designed and fabricated using processes available in an outside VCSEL foundry. \u00a0This device configuration allows for a manufacturable low inductance die attach to the submount, as well as reduced mechanical alignment tolerance to fiber coupling optics.\u00a0 Other approaches such as use of micro drilled holes in the submount are a fallback position if it later becomes clear that coupled cavity VCSELs are incompatible with backside emission or lens integration into the substrate. Second iterations of the drive IC and submount will be used in phase two, dependent on the results of phase 1.\u00a0 Table optics will still be used in phase 2, allowing for full optical beam characterization of the VCSEL array and built in microlens configuration.\u00a0 Phase 3 utilizes optical beam data from phase 2 for design of a molded plastic lens array.\u00a0 In this iteration, additional laser drilled mechanical alignment features will be added to submount 3, likely requiring use of a multi-layer low temperature co-fired ceramic process. With use of the built in microlens, and ball bonding of the VCSEL array to the LTCC submount pads, our design goal will be manual assembly of the lens array based on mechanical alignment of features in the lens array with features built into submount 3.\u00a0\u00a0"

        "Abstract": "Users of additive manufacturing machines expect the highest quality when it comes to the mechanical properties of parts, the usability of the machines and associated processes, and overall machine design. The main contributor to the quality of the part is the involvement of process-related by-products originating from the melting process. To handle these by-products in additive manufacturing - in the case of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) - an efficient gas flow over the build plate is required to enable high build rates, clean melting processes, and effective evacuation of the by-products, such as soot and spatter. In this STTR effort, the TDA team proposes to develop a comprehensive toolset based on an Integrated Computational Material Engineering (ICME) framework that enables optimizing the gas flow, including improvement in nozzle designs; gas circulation to match the design of the AM machine offering optimum shielding of the fusion area and the melt pool; and the efficient removal of the gas and debris from the chamber. The toolset also provides ways to set print parameters for optimum part performance for the raw material used and the scan patterns for the part. The toolset uses advanced computational fluid dynamic models and machine learning (ML)-based algorithms to model gas flow, spatter particle, and melt pool interactions. The key products from the proposed framework are: fluid-particle interaction model to adjust gas flow parameters to efficiently remove spatter and soot from the chamber; gas-melt pool dynamic interaction models to model melt pool dynamic, spatter and defect generation; microstructure and mechanical response models to understand the influence of gas flow on the cooling rate, heat affected area, microstructure, and material properties; ML-based algorithms for real-time detection of spatter particles and their trajectories via processing advanced in-situ monitoring data; chamber nozzle design models to control the gas flow; and the optimization framework for optimizing gas flow, print parameters, and scan patterns."

        "Abstract": "There is a growing need to accurately characterize nuclear materials not only for nuclear safeguards and nonproliferation treaty verification but also for forensics and provenance. Presently, nuclear material identification requires samples to be collected and sent to laboratories for analysis using large and expensive equipment, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers (ICP-MS) or secondary-ion mass spectrometers (SIMS). This can take weeks to obtain results, and utmost care must be taken to ensure the integrity of the sample. Optical techniques, such as laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and tunable diode laser absorption (TDLAS), show potential as viable field detectors for nuclear materials. However, field LIBS instruments suffer from poor spectral resolution to detect isotopic shifts of nuclear materials while TDLAS lack broad spectral coverage for multi-species detection. To overcome these limitations, we propose a fiber-based dual comb spectrometer (DCS) that provides both broad spectral coverage and high spectral resolution in a compact form factor. In recent work we have demonstrated the feasibility of this DFC approach by identifying and resolving isotopic and ground state hyperfine splittings in rubidium following a single laser ablation shot, as well as identification of multiple species simultaneously utilizing the inherently broad optical bandwidth of the DCS. In this Phase I effort, we will demonstrate the feasibility of fiber-based DFC as a compact field analyzer of trace elements capable of high resolving power to isotopes shifts and their ratio of nuclear surrogate materials over a broad spectral range. This will lead to the miniaturization of the instrument in Phase II."

        "Abstract": "Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS) and Prof. Rikky Muller at UC-Berkeley propose a two-phase effort to address current speed limitations\nin holographic photostimulation. Specifically, the proposed innovations aim to achieve streaming of high-resolution holograms at up to\n10,000 frames per second (fps) to enable closed-loop optogenetic control.Optical imaging and photostimulation have emerged as complimentary tools that allow not only direct imaging of neurons and their\nactivity, but also the ability to directly stimulate or inhibit activity in living brains. When performed through multiphoton microscopes\nequipped with phase-shaping SLMs, neuroscientists can now simultaneously control user-defined populations of neurons distributed\nacross different cortical layers in awake and behaving animals. This is accomplished through digital holography, in which the SLM\nproduces a three-dimensional light field in the sample (i.e., brain) with foci of light targeted directly to neurons of interest.Stimulation of specifically targeted groups of neurons more accurately mimics natural neural dynamics, in which neuronal ensembles\nare believed to be critical to encoding information. As a result, this holographic photostimulation approach is yielding novel insights into\nthe neural processes behind perception and learning that could not be gained through alternative means. Increasingly, neuroscientists\nwish to use this technique in closed-loop experimental protocols. In these protocols, the neural or behavioral activity of the animal would\ndictate the holographically targeted neurons, which in turn would further alter the activity in a real-time feedback loop. To realize this goal,\nneuroscientists require the computer-to-hologram pipeline to be accelerated well beyond 1,000 frames per second (fps) (\u2264 1 ms response\ntime). The fastest commercial SLMs, developed by Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS), can achieve up to 500 fps in holographic\nphotostimulation applications. Although these systems use a high-speed data pipeline capable of transmitting phase masks to the SLM\nat several kilohertz, these systems are limited by the liquid crystal used to modulate the phase of the light and are thus too slow for the\nenvisioned closed-loop protocols. Meanwhile, piston-type microelectromechanical system (MEMS) mirrors, developed by Prof. Rikky\nMuller\u2019s lab at UC-Berkeley, are capable of pixelated phase modulation at speeds on the order of 10 kHz. Translation of this approach\ninto the high-resolution modulators required for holography requires an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) capable of\naddressing many independent pixels with analog voltages andgt; 10 V and a data pipeline to transfer data at the speeds of the MEMS.In this two-phase effort, BNS and Prof. Rikky Muller at UC-Berkeley will remove these critical barriers by using the commercial BNS\nSLM backplanes as the MEMS ASIC and using the BNS drive electronics to achieve computer-to-hologram rates up to 10 kHz. In Phase\nI, we will rigorously characterize the compatibility of the Muller Labs\u2019 MEMS pixels with the BNS backplane and drive scheme using a\n64\u00d764 resolution MEMS array driven by a BNS 768\u00d7768 backplane assembled together on a host printed circuit board (PCB). This\narchitecture enables thorough and independent characterization of MEMS and backplane behaviors while being sufficient to demonstrate\nthe high-speed holography used in photostimulation protocols. This Phase I proof-of-concept MEMS SLM will have a maximum speed of\n2.5 kHz, which is already a 5\u00d7 improvement over the state-of-the-art. In Phase II, we will directly integrate the MEMS array onto the BNS\nbackplane, targeting up to a 512\u00d7512 MEMS SLM capable of up to 10 kHz frame rates, and demonstrate in vivo photostimulation at kHz\nspeeds. In addition, this MEMS SLM has strong applications in laser communications, atmospheric sensing, and AR\/VR near-eye display.There is an optical revolution underway in neuroscience that is providing researchers with new tools to both record and control neural\nactivity with light at the cellular level. Spatial light modulators (SLMs) are amongst the most powerful of these tools, in that they enable\nneuroscientists to holographically target neural stimulation or inhibition of 3D populations of cells in vivo. We propose a new SLM that\nmarries the kilohertz speeds of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) with proven commercial SLM drive techniques and\narchitectures to enable a new paradigm of high-speed neural interrogation and better understand the inner workings of the brain."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSignificance: Ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy is currently the most common surgical treatment for urinary\nstones\u2014a painful disease affecting 1 in 11 people and imposing a significant burden on the U.S.\nhealthcare system, with the cost of care exceeding $10 billion annually. Although laser lithotripsy breaks\nall types of stones, an emergent concern is that a large fraction of patients (around one in two) is left\nwith residual stone fragments when evaluated with computed tomography that are too small to laser\nefficiently but too large to pass spontaneously with urine flow. While the residual fragments are small in\ncomparison with the pre-treatment stone, the residual fragments nonetheless lead to high rates of post-\noperative emergency department visits, additional interventions, and recurrence of stones.\nPreliminary studies suggest that specially engineered microbubbles augment laser lithotripsy, producing\nsmaller residual fragments, which should lead to improved clinical outcomes. We hypothesize that\nengineered microbubbles augment laser lithotripsy by focusing energy into stones and stone fragments\nvia two main mechanisms: optical and mechanical. This is consistent with the mechanisms by which\nconventional laser lithotripsy ablates urinary stones, via direct laser light interactions with the stone\nsurface as well as mechanical effects due to the rapid vaporization and subsequent violent collapse of\nthe aqueous environment concomitant with each laser pulse.\nThe objective of this Phase I SBIR is to determine the feasibility of using specially engineered\nmicrobubbles to significantly reduce residual stone fragments and improve laser lithotripsy. In Aim 1,\nwe will identify mechanisms and sites of action of engineered microbubbles in laser lithotripsy. In Aim 2,\nwe will develop strategies to improve the effectiveness of laser lithotripsy with engineered microbubbles.\nThe innovation of the proposed approach is the use of engineered microbubbles that accumulate on\nurinary stones to augment stone fragmentation and reduce residual stone fragments in laser lithotripsy.\nThis approach has the potential to significantly improve the treatment for urinary stones by reducing the\nrisk of injury, procedural complications, and additional procedures, as well as result in a significant\nreduction in procedural time and cost. In addition, the knowledge gained from this feasibility study will\naid our understanding of the mechanisms by which conventional laser lithotripsy operates, and produce\nfurther insights into the treatment of biomineralization-related diseases.Public Health Relevance\nUrinary stones afflict millions of Americans every year and are associated not only with severe pain, but\nalso with high treatment costs and potentially life-threatening complications. Currently, the most\ncommon treatment for urinary stones involves a minimally invasive ureteroscopic laser procedure that\nintends to break urinary stones into sufficiently small fragments to allow them to pass naturally out of\nthe urinary system. This project aims at improving the laser procedure by using engineered\nmicrobubbles that will further reduce the residual stone fragment size\u2014an innovative way to pulverize\nstones into easily passed fragments."

        "Abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nDeNovX creates innovative platform products that improve crystallization. Phase I seeks to improve the\ncrystallization and sample handling efficiencies of high impact infectious disease related proteins by\nincorporating engineered nucleation features (ENFs) into microfluidic flow crystallization chips compatible with\nsingle crystal and serial crystallography using synchrotron X-ray and free electron laser (XFEL) lightsources.\nCrystal nucleation of proteins is challenging with the best workflows still averaging \u2265 80-85% failure rates.\nDeNovX\u2019s ENFs reduce the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers to crystal nucleation, and combining ENFs with\nmicrofluidic flow crystallization benefits structural biology by producing more protein crystals for fixed and\nflowing sample targetry in the emerging \u201cdiffract before destroying\u201d strategies with high brilliance X-rays and by\nmore efficiently using the protein resources. X-ray crystallography remains a benchmark technique by\nproviding unparalleled atomic resolution data that serve as models for cryo-EM and NMR structures, and\nbenefits to Public Health derive from an accelerated and expanded understanding of disease genesis,\nprogression, and therapy. Specific Aim 1 - Define microfluidic protein flow crystallization chip formats and\nincorporate ENFs. Using as benchmarks select carbohydrate active enzyme (CAzyme), \ua7b5-lactamase, and\nSARS-CoV-2 (e.g., Nsp15, Mpro, PLpro) proteins, collect replicate (n \u2265 6) crystallization hit percentage, crystal\nyield, and onset time data with 12 unique ENFs vs. control surfaces for the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)\/glass\nmicrofluidic materials of construction using microbatch crystallization. Identify the top four ENFs showing\nreproducible improvements of \u2265 10% increase in crystallization hits, \u2265 20% increase in the quantity of crystals\ngenerated, or \u2265 15% reduction in crystallization onset times vs. controls. Specific Aim 2 - Design a microfluidic\nprotein flow crystallization platform incorporating ENFs that can produce and transport: (a) 1-50 \u00b5m crystals for\nfixed target meshes and flowing sample microjet injection for serial femtosecond crystallography using XFELs,\nand (b) 50-100 \u00b5m protein crystals for traditional single crystal diffraction. Assemble two functional PDMS\/glass\n\u03b1-prototypes with \u2265 3 fluid addition points for manipulation of crystallization conditions, establish hydrodynamic\nconditions for operation, and demonstrate efficient transport of 1-50 \u00b5m and 50-100 \u00b5m protein crystals with\n\u2264 25% average change in droplet size (may affect crystal size). Specific Aim 3 - For protein microfluidic flow\ncrystallization using select ENFs and benchmark proteins (CAzymes, \ua7b5-lactamases, SARS-CoV-2),\ndemonstrate reproducible (n \u2265 6) improvements of \u2265 20% increase in the quantity of crystals generated, \u2265 20%\nreduction in crystallization onset time, or \u2265 20% narrowing of crystal size distribution vs. controls. Confirm using\nsynchrotron X-rays that structure quality metrics (e.g., resolution, R, etc.) of protein crystals are within \u00b1 3 esds\nof PDB benchmarks. It is expected that microfluidic protein flow crystallization will efficiently produce diffraction\nquality crystals to enhance the quality and quantity of protein structure determination studies.PROJECT NARRATIVE: RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH\nStructural biology facilitates the understanding of biological function, and new crystallization methods will assist\nresearchers in overcoming crystallization as the bottleneck and primary source of attrition in their studies.\nImprovements in protein crystallization will enhance productivity in structural biology, with Public Health\nbenefits accruing from faster and more complete structure\/function knowledge acquisition and more efficient\ndrug and vaccine development."

        "Abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe objective of this proposal is to design and validate a Periodontal Ultrasound\/Photoacoustic Imaging (PUPI)\ndevice which can non-invasively measure periodontal pocket depth, clinical attachment loss based on\ncementoenamel junction (CEJ) location, gingival biotype and inflammation. Current periodontal evaluation\nmethods are inaccurate because they are based on visual inspection and periodontal probing. While radiography\noffers detailed information about hard tissues such as bone and teeth, more detailed information about soft tissue\nis usually missed in radiography. Ultrasound\/photoacoustic approach has been used in soft tissue imaging but\nrarely in dentistry because they have a large size transducer which limits the entire oral cavity scan. This is a\nfundamental limitation of existing technology. To solve this problem, StyloSonic LLC will construct and validate\na miniaturized handpiece with a compact laser diode for ultrasound\/photoacoustic imaging to provide key\nperiodontal metrics. PUPI offers real-time, accurate, and repeatable measurements with utility in diagnosis and\ntherapy monitoring. That is the value of this proposal. The workflow will include two parts:\nAim 1 will design and fabricate the PUPI prototype and Aim 2 will evaluate the fundamental functionality of the\ndevice and confirm the validation in a pilot clinical study in collaboration with Dr. Casey Chen at University of\nSouthern California. 100 teeth (5-10 patients) with moderate periodontitis (pocket depth: 4-6 mm) will be\nevaluated with PUPI and manual probing method before and 4-week after the nonsurgical treatment (i.e., scaling\nand root planning). That will give us 80% statistical power assuming an alpha of 0.05 based on our preliminary\ndata. Our goal is to build a handpiece that can easily scan the entire oral cavity. We will test the designed\nminiaturized handpiece using an oral care manikin. We hypothesize that the correlation coefficient between\nprobing and PUPI is R2 andgt; 0.8. We also hypothesize that the PUPI will show a significant difference in pocket\ndepth, clinical attachment loss, gingival biotype and inflammation before and four weeks after treatment (p\nandlt;0.05).\nThis approach is innovative because for the first time, the miniaturized handpiece of PUPI will provide anatomical\nand functional information of the entire gingiva architecture. In addition, PUPI will enable accurate diagnostics\nand therapy monitoring which add enormous value for recommended treatment and ensure best outcomes. The\nclinical impact is the proposed device will assist dentists and periodontists to accurately diagnose gingivitis in\nthe early stage and reduce the rate of advanced periodontitis. This work will introduce a non-invasive and non-\nionizing dual modality imaging technique which has significant impacts on oral health care.PROJECT NARRATIVE\nDental health is critical to quality of life, but the tools that dentists use for periodontal exams are largely\nanatomical and inspect the gingiva by eye or periodontal charting. This work will develop and validate a non-\ninvasive Periodontal Ultrasound\/Photoacoustic Imaging (PUPI) with a miniaturized handpiece. This will facilitate\naccurate early diagnosis of periodontitis which leads to the improvement of the treatment and ensures best\noutcomes."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT\nAll aspects of healthcare delivery have been disrupted by the Covid pandemic. In this emerging era of new\npathogens and drug-resistance, even mundane and standard-of-care practices must now account for the\nsafety of the patient \/ provider interaction. This safety requirement is an immediate unmet need in\nclinical medicine. An example is the process of capturing cardiovascular Vital Sign data using the Conventional\nInteractive Monitoring (CIM) tools of a wristwatch, a single-point pulse oximeter, and a sphygmomanometer at\nthe beginning of the clinic visit. This data capture encounter now puts patients and providers at risk.\nRFPi\u2019s groundbreaking Multi-spectral Physiologic Visualization (MSPV) is an entirely non-contact, non-\ninvasive, and non-ionizing medical imaging technology that provides: 1) Blood Flow Distribution (flow in\nvessels AND perfusion in tissues) in the Field of View (FOV); 2) 2D peripheral oxygen saturation (2D SpO2) in\ntissues in the same FOV; and 3) cardiovascular physiologic status parameters of heart rate, blood pressure,\nrate-pressure product, perfusion variation, and others from the metadata of the BFD imaging. This analysis\ndisplay is presented in immediate real-time from 10-14 seconds of coherent NIR laser and Visible light\nimaging. The first clinical form factor of MSPV, called iCertainty\u2122, is FDA-approved for open surgical use.\nPrior studies have indicated that the MSPV data meet or exceed current clinical practice data standards for\nconsistency, variability, and accuracy. A clinic-appropriate form factor of the MSPV technology would\neliminate this encounter risk while capturing better quality cardiovascular Vital Sign data for better decision-\nmaking and care delivery.\nThis Phase I proposal objective is to re-engineer the MSPV patient optics-tissue interface into a 1.5-2.5 cm\nworking distance (camera lens to tissue surface distance). This presents a number of optics engineering and\ndesign challenges, so RFPi has brought together two outstanding Collaborating Organizations: INOV INC, a\n30-year optics design and engineering firm (over $500 M in revenue generated by clients from INOV\u2019s product\ndesigns), and Nocturnal Product Development, LLC, a leading medical device design company in Durham, NC.\nThe two Specific Aims of the proposal are to: 1) Develop the optics solutions to optimize the Illumination and\nReflectance Image Capture challenges resulting from this short WD; and 2) Prototype Build of a Medical Grade\nPhysiology Determination (MGPD) device, with clinical proof-of-concept testing in 50 adult volunteer subjects\nin the MSPV-NOED Study to determine consistency, variability and accuracy vs. the CIM tools currently in use.\nThese Phase I data and this Collaborating Organization team will quickly move to a Phase II application\ndesigned to build and test a clinical MGPD form factor for FDA submission. This highly innovative technology\napproach has the potential to impact patient and provider safety, as well as Vital Sign data quality, in the andgt;\n40,000 designated outpatient clinic sites in the United States documented in 2018.NARRATIVE\nRFPi, Inc. a mid-sized small business entity startup, intends to make the routine capture of Vital Sign data at\nthe time of a clinic visit safer for both patients and providers. RFPi\u2019s groundbreaking technology uses non-\ncontact medical imaging to capture these Vital Signs data. In the Covid era and beyond, this groundbreaking\nRFPi approach will improve patient \/ provider safety, and the better Vital Sign data will improve patient care."

        "Abstract": "Project Summary\nBiocatalyst can be key tools in the synthesis of natural product-based pharmaceuticals and as powerful components\nof the pharmaceutical chemist\u2019s drug modification kit. For example, the aromatic prenyltransferase NphB has utility in\nthe synthesis of common prenylated compounds or derived backbones include cannabinoids, alpha acids, beta acids,\nphenylpropanoids, naphterpins, and marinones. The same enzyme also has utility as a general tool for compound\nfunctionalization. Our partner, BioMediCan has developed a whole cell biocatalysis platform based on this enzyme for\nproduction of natural and nonnatural rare cannabinoids. However, for all the attractive qualities and uses of enzyme-\nbased or whole-cell biocatalysis, NphB as well as many other enzymes have not evolved with the characteristics\nrequired for industrial or pharmaceutical goals. These limitations arise because of the limitations of conventional\nanalytical methods and the narrow detection capabilities of the current suite of ultrahigh-throughput microfluidic\ntechniques. To develop novel high efficient platform and to improve the NphB biocatalyst, Fluid Discovery will engineer\na microfluidic based biocatalysis sample preparation system with capacities of high throughput sample processing\nand low cost and enable its seamless coupling with matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization (MALDI) mass\nspectrometry for high sensitivity and general applicability. This method, called \u03bcMALDI-TOF, will not only allow Fluid\nDiscovery and BioMediCan to take the first steps towards becoming a key provider of novel compounds and enzymatic\ntools, but also provide a quantum leap in biocatalyst discovery and engineering through a highly scalable and universal\nscreening platform. Our Phase I goal is to establish and demonstrate the capacity of this platform on engineering\nNphB in whole cell biocatalysis. In Phase II, we will continue our work via engineering NphB for improving and\nexpanding the current whole-cell biocatalyst platform and initiate contracted service to early access synthetic biology\ncompanies. Ultimately, we plan to leverage the generality of our product for applications in the generation of\nbiocatalysts for either green chemistry drug production or as tools for the molecular diversification that underlies lead\ncompound modification and optimization.Narrative\nBiocatalyst such as prenylation enzyme is a key element in the discovery, production, and pharmaceutical application\nof natural products; however, access to sufficiently functional biocatalysts often requires dedicated discovery and\nreengineering before they can be used. The goal of this project will be to develop a platform for high throughput\nengineering aromatic prenyltransferase, NphB, which has direct applications to produce novel pharmaceutical active\ncompounds from the phenylpropanoids, cannabinoids, and aromatic chemical families. Furthermore, the platform\ndeveloped during this project is highly extendable to other drug discovery or pharmaceutical discovery efforts."

        "Abstract": "Significance: There is a need for a safe and effective office-based lithotripsy treatment for kidney stones. Kidney stones are common; they affect nearly 10% of the US population and the prevalence continues to grow in parallel with diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Kidney stones are also one of the costliest urologic diseases in America; the health care burden in the US exceeds $10 billion annually. A substantial portion of this cost is due to the approximately one million surgical interventions and 20-40% rate of unplanned post-surgical events. This includes extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), a common noninvasive surgical intervention, and ureteroscopy laser lithotripsy (URS), a common endoscopic procedure. Both have a 5% or greater risk of significant adverse events and, in the US, both procedures are conducted within a surgical suite with the patient anesthetized. Technology: SonoMotion is developing Break WaveTM, an office-based, non-invasive, and anesthesia free lithotripsy solution for kidney and ureteral stones to redefine the standard of care for millions of people. Break Wave employs a novel technology that uses multi-cycle, low-amplitude pulses of ultrasound rather than shock waves to induce stone fracture. This approach has the potential to reduce the risk of injury and the rate of procedural complications, as well as significantly lower procedural time and cost. Furthermore, the low amplitude pulses will preclude the need for anesthesia, providing an office-based treatment method. This could also potentially provide an attractive alternative to active surveillance of an obstructing stone. Preliminary Data: In vitro studies have shown the Break Wave technology is capable of breaking most common human stone types into fragment that are consistently 1-2 mm in size. Clinical simulation conducted in a porcine model indicates the ultrasound dose required to break stones is below the level required to induce renal injury. Clinical studies show the technology safe and effective in humans. Specific Aim: The specific aim included in the current project are focused on activities required for commercialization and widespread market adoption, including late-stage device design and procedural adjustments as informed by bench top and clinical studies.NARRATIVE\nOne in 11 Americans will have kidney stones in their lifetime. Most of the $10B annual cost of this disease is incurred\nby visits to the emergency department, surgery, and unplanned post-surgery events. The proposed work has the goal\nof commercializing Break Wave, a promising new technology that offers an office-based and anesthesia-free method\nto fragment stones that has the potential to reduce complications and costs associated with current stone\nmanagement."

        "Abstract": "Project Summary. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is among the most powerful analytical\ntechniques ever invented, as recognized by 6 Nobel Prizes for methods development alone.\nNonetheless, NMR is notoriously plagued by poor sensitivity. State-of-the-art NMR\nspectrometers feature detection thresholds of ~1 nanomole for \u00b5L sample volumes (~100\nnanograms). This places NMR sensitivity many orders of magnitude behind other analytical\nchemistry techniques such as mass spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, and fluorescence\nlabeling. Improvements in NMR often focus on using larger magnets, but progress has\nplateaued; over the last 25 years, the fundamental signal strength has only increased ~2-fold.\nWe seek to fundamentally change the NMR hardware by using diamond films doped with\nNitrogen-Vacancy centers to detect nuclear magnetization non-inductively via pulsed optically\ndetected magnetic resonance methods. The form factor of our NMR detector is easily integrated\nwith hyphenation techniques so that samples can be separated into sub-components before\nanalysis. Recently, we built a tabletop microfluidic diamond NMR apparatus with 40 pL detection\nvolume and used it in proof-of-principle analytical chemistry applications including the first 2D\nNMR spectra acquired by a diamond NMR sensor. In Phase I, we will optimize sensor spectral\nresolution and sensitivity and validate its operation using metabolite mixtures. This work will\nplace us in the position to deliver our devices to end-users in industry (Merck) and academia\n(UW) and incorporate feedback to scale up to market.\nIf successful, our prototype could have a profound impact on analytic biochemistry research, by\ncombining mass-spectrometry-level sensitivity with NMR-level accuracy. Specifically, we\nimprove upon existing analytical methods by offering:\n1. Greater performance. We offer 1000-fold better sensitivity (pmol instead of nmol) than\ncurrent NMR spectrometers. This sensitivity approaches that of mass spectrometry but retains\nbenefits of NMR such as non-destructive, absolute quantitation and structural identification.\n2. Compatibility with hyphenated separation techniques. Our spectrometer is compact and\neasily integrated into microfluidic chips for online chromatography-based assays (HPLC) for\nsample-limited analyses (metabolomics, pharmacodynamics, natural products).\n3. Lower cost. The small sample volume in our spectrometer leads to reduced engineering\ncosts, leading to greater affordability compared to current NMR spectrometers.ODMR Technologies, in collaboration with UNM, seeks to fundamentally change the hardware\nused in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy by using laser and microwave interrogation\nof a diamond quantum sensor embedded in a microfluidic chip. If successful, the microfluidic\ndiamond spectrometer will be used to quantify metabolite concentrations for applications in\nanalytical biochemistry and drug development."

        "Abstract": "A. Background Information The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance the treatment of cancer using laser plasma accelerator physics breakthroughs at LBNL to build a miniature electron accelerator as a variable Xrays source with clinically relevant dose-rates of ~0.7 Gy\/min and energies between 0.25 \u2013 5 MeV. This electronic particle brachytherapy source is powered by a commercial, laser system, operating up to 1000 Hz and 7 W of average power. The flexibility of the laser driver allows treatment with radioisotope-free operation and variable x-ray energy on a pulse-by-pulse basis. This confers extra degrees of freedom for the treatment planning process thus providing the clinician the ability to improve the dose delivery. Unwanted dose to nearby healthy tissue and critical structures is reduced. This proposal brings a world-class team together: LBNL in laser plasma accelerators and optical fiber-based delivery systems, Woodtoga to translate the technology into clinically relevant products with expertise in bonding and the creation of miniature X-ray devices, and Varian Medical Systems as the commercial partner. Integrating the technology with clinical practice, treatment planning, into a radiation oncology platform transforming the field of brachytherapy."

        "Abstract": "Ultrafast infrared laser systems have been proposed for use in many areas of DOE and industrial applications. Current available infrared femtosecond lasers are unstable, complicated, cost-intensive, inefficient, and bulky. Fiber lasers have become key workhorses for power scaling of ultrafast laser sources because of their advantages including inherent simplicity, compactness, low-cost, high efficiency, outstanding heat-dissipating capability, and excellent beam quality. Leveraging on our substantial experience in developing ultrafast fiber lasers at 2 \uf06dm and our unique short-length highly doped fiber laser technology for ultrashort pulse amplification with low nonlinear distortions, NP Photonics, in collaboration with the College of Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona, proposes to develop a compact and robust single-polarization ultrafast fiber laser source at 2.1 \uf06dm with exceptional operation stability and reliability. In this Phase I program, we will focus on the development of a compact and robust mode-locked all-fiber laser oscillator with exceptionally high polarization extinction ratio and highly holmium-doped polarization maintaining fiber amplifiers for energy scaling of ultrafast laser at 2.1 \uf06dm. A compact and robust ultrafast laser source at 2.1 \uf06dm meeting or exceeding the requirements of DOE\u2019s applications will be developed in Phase II. In addition to DOE applications, the proposed high- energy ultrafast lasers can also be used for direct energy weapons, material processing, highly nonlinear process in atoms and molecules, and scientific research."

        "Abstract": "There is an unsatisfied demand for instrumentation with capabilities for nonintrusive, accurate direct measurements of transport and thermodynamic parameters in the high-speed flow, hyperthermal environment of NASA Arc Jet Complex facilities. Atomic and molecular-based optical diagnostics have been demonstrated to provide unprecedent insight into the dynamics and transport phenomena of reactive and non-reactive flows at spatio-temporal scales inaccessible to traditional (mostly intrusive) flow probes. High repetition rate femtosecond (fs) lasers and high-speed imaging systems have equipped them with new capabilities and new laser-based diagnostics have emerged. However, no single measurement technique can capture and quantify all the phenomena and variables of interest over a wide range of operational conditions.nbsp;We will develop and deliver a mobile multifunctional optical diagnostic platform for non-intrusive, quantitative imaging of relevant gas parameters in arc driven and other high enthalpy ground testing facilities. The platform is powered by a single fs laser and implements and integrates three state-of-the art optical diagnostic techniques: Two Photon Absorption Laser Induced Fluorescence (TALIF), a coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) and Femtosecond Laser Electronic Excitation Tagging (FLEET). The core laser system enables kHz rate nonintrusive measurements of species density, nonequilibrium temperature and velocity. Multiple measurements can be achieved at reduced implementation and operational costs. Such direct experimental data are essential for validating predictions, and for the design and testing of thermal protection systems."

        "Abstract": "Technical Abstract: (Limit 2,000 characters) No proprietary infoRC Integrated Systems LLC (RISL), with support from Lockheed Martin Space (LMS) and in collaboration with TechOpp Consulting Inc., proposes to advance the development of a novel Miniature Optical Proximity Sensor (MOPS), capable of providing sub-mm range resolution for the measurement of an arbitrary target ranging from contact to over 20cm. This new sensor will achieve over 1 kHz frequency response, consume less than 55mW power, weigh about 7.1 grams, and cost less than 100 dollars. The MOPS addresses NASArsquo;s need for a low mass low power proximity sensor which can be mounted at the end of a robotic arm. The MOPS sensor is based on unique laser interferometry. The outcome of the Phase I program was the successful feasibility demonstration of the MOPS technology through extensive design, modeling, prototype development, and laboratory testing and demonstration. Anbsp;Technology Readiness Level (TRL-) 4 prototype was tested in a laboratory environment to achieve better than sub-mm range resolution with a target over 20 cm simulating satellite surface conditions. At the end of Phase II, RISL will perform a TRL-6 prototype demonstration of the MOPS technology at RISL or anbsp;NASA facility, and will deliver to NASA 10 fully operational MOPS prototypes."

        "Abstract": "The detection of combat divers employing a portable signal beacon is critical to the success of a mission. Previously, Sheaumann Laser designed and produced TRL-6+ MWIR flashlights for DoD end users, who were quite satisfied as the devices performed above and beyond the original requirements and were delivered much sooner than expected. In response to the current solicitation, Sheaumann performed a feasibility study for modifying its current flashlight design to accommodate new requirements - most importantly, a wet-swappable feature \u2013 as well as additional design elements that could be incorporated to further enhance the performance of the beacon. During the Direct to Phase II activity, Sheaumann will implement these design changes and produce new prototypes for MIL-SPEC testing at an accredited laboratory and in the field, thereby establishing TRL-7. Upon completion of the proposed effort, Sheaumann will be positioned for large-scale production of this device along with in-house quantum cascade laser manufacturing capabilities."

        "Abstract": "Under this STTR program, QuesTek Innovations will utilize its knowledge and expertise in Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) to develop high-performance, additively manufacturable Mg alloys for application in repairs or as a lightweight structural component in aircraft. The need for accelerated development and desired performance ranging from mechanical properties, AM processability to oxidation and corrosion properties necessitate the implementation of an ICME framework to computationally design an improved alloy composition and associated processing. QuesTek will leverage its expertise in computational materials design, utilizing CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD)-based modeling techniques to evaluate a multidimensional composition space to design an alloy with optimal microstructural features to achieve the desired properties of high strength, low density, and improved oxidation and corrosion resistance. QuesTek will partner with Prof. Dan Thoma\u2019s group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who are uniquely qualified to perform accelerated, high-throughput material synthesis (via elemental powder blending) utilizing directed energy deposition. Additionally, QuesTek will partner with Prof. Michele Manuel at the University of Florida to leverage her extensive expertise in design and development of Mg alloys. In Phase I of the program, the team will computationally design a novel Mg alloy, develop DED processing conditions to prototype the designed alloy, and perform microstructural characterization and mechanical testing. Future phases of the program will involve evaluation of scaled up prototypes and direct component manufacturing techniques such as Laser Powder-bed fusion (L-PBF) techniques using industrial alloy powder production."

        "Abstract": "Protection of the US Homeland from disease causing and deadly biological threats requires the ability to rapidly identify aerosolized materials that can include a wide range of biological components alone, and in mixtures. Our proposed sensor technology for this multiplexed identification tool is a modification of our existing aerosol-sampling bioidentifier. The proposed system collects bioaerosol particles and uses laser-based, time-of-flight mass spectrometry to determine the masses of the biomolecules (proteins, peptide, lipids, carbohydrates) across a wide mass range (100-100,000 Daltons).Current versions of this sensor have been focused on identification of single individual threat agents in a series of complex backgrounds, The work proposed here seeks to greatly enhance the mass spectral resolution such that complex mixtures can be more readily deconvoluted and identified. Initial modeling and simulation studies have been conducted that predict that modification of the mass spectrometer analytical engine can result in more that an order of magnitude enhancement of spectral resolution. This will enable the system to identify the individual threat materials in mixtures of five or more components. The development of such a system will support protective systems against biothreats for government uses and in the commercial sector at commercial buildings, entertainment venues, shopping centers and transportation systems."

        "Abstract": "Transparent quantum networks will enable rapid scaling and broad geographic accessibility to quantum computation and communication systems. Before such goals can be achieved, suitable optoelectronic components must be developed that are capable of carrying, routing, and heralding quantum information. Key amongst these components are stable, narrow linewidth lasers, commercial options of which are bulky, expensive, and exhibit inferior performance to state-of-the-art in academia. Proposed herein is a narrow linewidth quantum dot laser that leverages an epitaxial active-passive platform that will enable &gt;100\u00d7 reduction in cost, a chip-scale device footprint, and performance matching state-of-the-art. The platform utilizes a vertically offset passive waveguide in the epitaxial material stack that can, through top-down fabrication, be designed to include rings, gratings, phase shifters, and other passive optical technologies. With tailored designs this platform could produce &lt; 150 kHz narrow-linewidth lasers, fast tunable lasers, optical frequency combs, and single photon sources. The designs can be engineered to deliver high power levels suitable for short-reach (25 mW using a novel technology platform. Devices will be simulated to optimize the epitaxial layer stack in pursuit of high power and narrow linewidth. This will require independent evaluation of the gain region and all passive cavity elements. Designs will emphasize both performance and manufacturability. Subsequent work in Phases II and III would involve experimental demonstration of the proposed platform including performance meeting the program metrics. Following proof-of-concept, the manufacturing process would be scaled using foundry partners. Laser epi growth and device fabrication would utilize US based manufacturers and be capable of scaling to large volumes. While the benefits of a high-performance narrow linewidth laser are apparent, this platform could also enable other devices to meet the needs of current and future quantum networks and broader applications in communications, sensing, and other areas of optoelectronics."

        "Abstract": "Synchrotron light sources and X-ray free electron lasers are now generating shorter pulses with more intense light than ever before possible, granting unparalleled access to new discoveries. X-ray detectors have not kept pace with these improvements. The field of soft x-ray detection is particularly behind in detector development due to low signal levels resulting from the lower energy x-rays and high vacuum requirements. Existing detectors are often not commercially available, and do not address the need for single photon counting, event counting, and high image resolution simultaneously. This technology gap prevents advancements in fields like time resolved photoemission or x-ray photon-correlation spectroscopy. The proposed program will advance the development of a novel coupled microchannel plate (MCP) - application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) soft x-ray detector (CAMP) for multi-event encoding soft x-ray experiments. Laboratory-level prototypes of the CAMP detector have demonstrated single photon sensitivity and ability to correlate 104 simultaneous events with &lt; 2 ns time resolution using a Timepix3 ASIC. The technology exists in a laboratory setting, but is not widely available to the soft x-ray community as a whole. The proposed program will leverage the developments existing in the literature and investigate the feasibility of transitioning the technology to a commercial instrument. The primary objective of the proposed program is to leverage the laboratory research and development in the literature and define a program to produce a commercial prototype. This will be done through leveraging connections with the user community to define detector requirements, creating a knowledge base of existing laboratory prototypes, and Sydor\u2019s experience commercializing similar x-ray detectors alongside the scientific community. Phase I will culminate in a conceptual design for a commercial prototype to be produced in Phase II along with a product road map for future product releases. A robust and commercially supported detector with the combined low signal amplification of an MCP and simultaneous event encoding ability of an ASIC will enable discovery in soft x-ray experiments not currently possible. Current commercial offerings often use indirect detection which limits temporal resolution, and are only capable of counting &lt; 10 simultaneous events (multi-anode photomultiplier tubes). This proposed CAMP detector will provide good time resolution, &lt; 10 \u00b5m spatial resolution with centroiding, and encoding of up to ~ 104 simultaneous single photon events, drastically improving scientist\u2019s ability to collect data, and allowing greater insight into materials."

        "Abstract": "The impacts of aerosol on cloud properties remains a major obstacle to better understanding of Earth\u2019s changing energy budget. Quantifying their impacts is a DOE objective and of broader benefit to the public. Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nucleating particles (INP) have a potentially major impact on cloud droplet number and size, and thereby affect cloud radiative properties, cloud lifetime, and precipitation. Improving observational capabilities for airborne CCN and INP measurements is required to advance understanding and extend current measurements into a wider geographic region, including under-sampled regions, and for longer time periods. There is also a need for smaller, lower-cost and lightweight instruments capable of measuring CCN and INP for use on rapidly advancing unmanned platforms, including unmanned aerial vehicles as well as tethered and free balloons. To address these needs, we propose commercial development of a simple, lower cost, low power consumption and small footprint CCN counter based on the static diffusion chamber design, which will be integrated with a filter and particle sizing systems to provide microphysical aerosol measurement package for use on airborne platforms. The proposed CCN instrument is an extension of the first commercially available CCN counter, which has been significantly overhauled to take advantage of developments of extremely low-cost digital cameras, lasers, mechanical hardware, electronics, computers, and image processing software. We anticipate 1-2 order of magnitude reduction in cost compared to existing commercial CCN counters and large reductions in size and weight (the miniaturized device is approximately 6 x 3 x 3 inches; 600 g). We will build on initial proof-of- concept testing to adapt for airborne measurements, including motion and vibration. Future commercial applications include use by atmospheric researchers seeking a low cost, high performance and easy to use instrument for use on UAS and field studies."

        "Abstract": "In this project, we seek to study a novel, potentially transformational approach to the implementation of high-brightness photocathode sources. Currently, the performance of many electron sources for applications such as the LCLS-II x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) as well as electron microscopes and ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) systems, is limited by the brightness of the electron beams. This is a particular issue in the implementation of very high repetition-rate ~MHz electron sources, since in this case, the use of a high quantum efficiency (QE) photocathode is necessary. KMLabs has recently developed and commercialized a new technology for generating ultrashort laser pulses in the deep-UV and VUV, at MHz repetition-rate. By using a new, highly-cascaded, four-wave mixing upconversion process - rather than the more-commonly used nonlinear crystals \u2013 it is possible to generate ultrafast pulses at wavelengths from 350 nm to 110 nm with extremely-high beam quality, and with unprecedented brightness and average power for these short wavelengths. The high beam quality results from the single-mode nature of this guided-wave highly-cascaded harmonic generation (HCHG) technique. Moreover, the nonresonant nature of the four-wave mixing interaction results in low spectral distortion during the upconversion process, making it possible to temporally shape pulses in the infrared and translate this shaping into the deep-UV with high fidelity. These capabilities make it an ideal candidate for next-generation photocathodes. In this project, we proposed to implement and characterize deep-UV sources using gas phase upconversion to ~250-270 nm, to drive Cs2Te photocathodes at repetition-rates from 100 kHz-1MHz. By shaping one or more of the infrared laser pulses that are used to drive the upconversion process, in Phase I we will show that we can generate UV pulses with a broad and precisely-controllable spectral shape. We have extensive experience with pulse shaping technology. Using spectrally-chirped 10\u2019s of ps pulses required for XFEL photocathodes, it will be possible to generate precise temporally-shaped electron pulses for ultrahigh brightness sources, leveraging the US investment in XFEL technology to enable higher photon energy lasing of XFELs. In Phase II, we plan to scale our results to the MHz repetition rates and the &gt;~\u00b5J pulse energies required for full implementation, as well as to validate strategies for spatial profile shaping of the deep-UV light. In phase I, we expect to coordinate with both the photocathode group at LCLS-II (Sergio Carbajo) and the superconducting electron gun group at Argonne (Phillippe Piot, John Byrd), while in Phase II we anticipate experimental collaboration with these groups. We plan in Phase I to work primarily with an existing prototype MHz fiber laser system at KMLabs to characterize the beam quality of the output at 258 nm, and to demonstrate that this new process allows for flexible manipulation of the spectral shape of the UV output. Phase II will pursue a demonstrator system at higher power."

        "Abstract": "Accurate measurements of cloud microphysical properties are critical for improving numerical weather and Earth system models. Airborne measurements of properties critically important to improving model accuracy, such as drop size distributions and liquid water content, have historically suffered from significant uncertainties and large discrepancies between instruments. To address these weaknesses, DOE has requested development of an instrument for airborne platforms which greatly improves resolution and accuracy of drop size distribution and liquid water content measurements over current techniques. In response to this call, this project will develop and test a novel laser-based optical technique which takes advantage of the angular dependence of single particle scattering, rather than the integrated scattering intensity approach used by current instrumentation. This approach avoids the uncertainties inherent in integrated scattering approach caused by non-monotonic response to droplet size, instead relating relative intensities captured at high angular resolution to particle size, leading to a greater than 80% reduction in uncertainty over existing techniques. Multiple laser wavelengths will be used to further enhance the sizing accuracy. In Phase I, a breadboard optical system will be designed and built, then tested using NIST- traceable size standards and precisely sized water drops produced by a piezoelectric droplet generator. Test results will be analyzed using specialized software to validate instrument sizing response and determine overall accuracy. In future phases, the technique will be engineered and refined for deployment on airborne platforms (manned aircraft, UAV, balloon). Given the improvements this approach offers over existing instruments, which currently provide a \u2018core\u2019 measurement for airborne platforms, instruments using this approach will be adopted on research aircraft worldwide, in almost all mission profiles."

        "Abstract": "Spin-polarized electrons are required by several projects relevant to the U.S. Department of Energy mission. More- over, many next generation applications require generation of spin-polarized electron beams with high bunch charge (up to 50 nC) and\/or high average current (50 mA). Currently, GaAs-related photocathodes, based on different designs, are used to emit electron beams with high polarization. However, it is still a major challenge to achieve the required high bunch charge and\/or average current from GaAs photocathodes. In order to reduce the risk for the successful delivery and operation of next generation systems, development of new cathodes for emission of high bunch charge polarized electrons is of interest. Recent experiments with semiconductor\/insulator\/ferromagnetic metal heterostructures have demonstrated the potential to deliver very high-current spin-polarized electron beams. The optimal material configurations of these cathodes are still to be determined. Detailed, three-dimensional simulations are expected to provide an efficient way to explore the properties of new spin-filter cathodes and help guide their design. However, there are no available codes that provide these capabilities. We propose to address this problem by developing software to model transport of spin-polarized electrons through heterostructure materials, including spin-dependent electron-electron scattering in ferromagnetic metallic layers, and electron emission for efficient investigation and design of spin-filter cathodes. The Phase I portion of this project will specifically address the issues of developing a combined effort of simulation and validation. We plan to develop software to model the transport of electrons, with both charge and spin degrees of freedom included, through spin-filter cathode designs. Our approach also includes models of spin-dependent emission. We also plan to team with researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) to perform specific experiments to validate these models. The models we plan to implement will be of direct benefit to DOE scientists at Brookhaven National Lab and Jefferson National Lab who are working to design and develop high-average- current polarized electron sources for advanced electron-ion collider, electron cooling, and nuclear and accelerator physics applications. We expect that results from realistic simulations with a 3D PIC code will provide valuable feedback to them and will ultimately help them to produce novel polarized electron sources that meet, or exceed, the requirements for use in next generation DOE electron-ion collider facilities. In the commercial sector, the new multi-material (semiconductor, insulator, metal) modeling capabilities will be most relevant for design of semiconductor devices that depend on electron spin properties, such as spin-based electronics (spintronics) for magnetic storage media, semiconductor lasers, and magnetic tunnel transistors."

        "Abstract": "Resodyn has developed the novel Resonant Acoustic Continuous Crystallizer (RACC) concept which is specifically configured for the recrystallization of energetic nitramines. This technology employs the Resonant Acoustic Mixing technology, which results in a uniform shear field throughout the mixing vessel. Radial mixing is accomplished to such a significant degree that true plug flow is achieved. Continuous recrystallization of nitramines such as RDX and HMX will result in increased process throughput, improved product quality and seamless scalability of the crystallization step from bench through production. The RACC process is inherently scalable since the mixing field is achieved without internal impellers or baffles and does not rely on high Reynold\u2019s number or high shear rates to achieve mixing. The RACC technology employees a simple reactor design which has minimal pressure drop, even with increased crystal growth. The RACC concept is also highly amendable to employing Process Analytical Tools for Quality by Control. The independent process variables which will impact mean crystal size and particle size distribution width are adjustable by varying processing conditions, and do not require changes to reactor geometry or other difficult-to-adjust variables. The proposed Phase 1 project will demonstrate the RACC concept for the recrystallization of 2,6\u2010diaminopyrazine\u20101\u2010oxide (DAPO) as a surrogate for energetic materials. A prototype RACC will be designed, built and demonstrated for the crystallization of DAPO. In order to demonstrate appropriate tunability and control of the process, the relationship between independent process variables on DAPO crystal size and particle size width distribution will be determined online using ultrasonic velocity measurement and verified with offline laser diffraction measurements. These results will be compared to recrystallization results using a classic stirred tank reactor design in order to quantify improvements in crystal production. The results of DAPO crystallization in the prototype RACC will illuminate the benefits of the technology and lay the foundation for pilot demonstration of RACC for the recrystallization of energetic materials in Phase II."

        "Abstract": "We propose a master oscillator power amplifier concept that employs a single master oscillator distributed to multiple power amplifiers with intermediate phase and amplitude modulators to produce a 2-D array of laser beams with controlled phase and intensity relationships. This allows for the coherent beam combining using a free space multiplane light conversion approach to achieve a multi-kW laser beam with high beam quality (M2 &lt; 1.5). We plan to fabricate an array of tapered semiconductor optical amplifiers integrated with input intensity and phase modulators using a 1xN waveguide star coupler. These will be implemented on a strained InGaAs\/GaAs MQW laser structure that is optimized for highest optical gain at 980 nm. We will employ controlled MQW disordering to achieve a slightly larger bandgap of the MQW in the modulator sections and either employ more extensive disordering of the MQW layer or hybrid silicon nitride layer for the passive waveguide sections and the 1xN integrated coupler. The semiconductor chips will be stacked and a single DFB laser diode will be distributed to the individual integrated SOA bar using a fiber 1xN coupler. The 2-D array of coherent output beams will be then combined using a free-space multiplane light conversion technique. Because we have the freedom to control the phase and amplitude of every single beam in the matrix of laser beams, it will be possible to achieve a very high combination efficiency while minimizing optical beam distortions to produce a high brightness single mode laser beam. This method of coherent beam combining will effectively mitigate any beam array spacing irregularity caused by \u201csmile\u201d, as long as the irregularity is static or predictable. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We will analyze the heat flow dynamics of the SOA arrays and use both conventional microchannel liquid cooling of the heatsinks as well as an integrated aerosol spray cooling delivered through an array of micro-jets positioned directly above the heat dissipating surface. This will dictate the fill factor of the SOA arrays. Traditionally most commercial tapered SOAs employ gain guiding in the tapered amplifying section. While this make fabrication much simpler and the exact taper angle is less critical, there a penalty in the attainable best wall-plug efficiency.\u00a0 As long as the electrical contact metal on top of the active region is wide enough to cover the whole width of the Gaussian\u2013like mode, the whole beam is amplified. However, the very nature of a Gaussian beam is that it does not really have a finite width, as will be discussed in more details in the proposal. In contrast, the\u00a0index guided tapered SOAs\u00a0potentially yield a significant improvement on the wall-plug efficiency.\u00a0 \u00a0We have assembled a strong team with outstanding expertise in semiconductor optoelectronic device integration, optical system integration, as well as technology transfer and commercialization."

        "Abstract": "Surface-emitting lasers (SEL) are advantageous for high power laser applications due to their unique properties of circular beams, the absence of catastrophic optical damage (COD), and their suitability for 2D integration for power scaling. Ideally, these lasers should be monolithic, electrically pumped (EP), with single mode emission and close to diffraction limited optical beam output. Recently it has been discovered that high quality-factor (Q-factor) cavities can be achieved through the use of a single defect-free photonic crystal (PC) slab which is evanescently coupled to a neighboring gain region. In these devices, coined photonic crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs), the lasing state corresponds to a single, high-Q point in the PC band structure which exists above the light line. Due to the lateral cavity size scalability, high power single mode large area PCSELs are possible with high brightness and diffraction limited beams. Since the principle of the PCSEL can be applied to all frequency ranges of electromagnetics, it is feasible to scale the wavelengths from deep UV all the way to midwave- and far- infrared (MWIR, FIR) and THz. Many different material systems can be explored for high power laser applications. The objective of this SBIR Phase I project is to formulate the trade-space towards the design and development of high-power high-beam quality photonic crystal surface emitting laser (PCSEL) through a modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) approach. The simulation tool consists of four different modules for the electrical, optical, and mechanical designs of PCSELs at high power levels. The model will also be validated with experimental development. \u00a0By the end of Phase I base period, we will complete PCSEL modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) tool which include four major modules. The tool is capable of design of PCSELs from visible to infrared based on at least two or three different material systems (GaAs, InP, GaSb). The tool is also capable of PCSEL performance evaluations in terms of threshold current, output power, efficiency, beam quality, and thermal management, etc. By the end of Phase I option period, we will have at least one (or two) PCSEL\u00a0 designs\u00a0based on InP and\/or GaSb materials, depending on the feedback and request from the Army. We will also carry out some preliminary experiments by completing one set of devices runs, from material growth and regrowth, to device fabrication and characterization. A Phase II proposal will also be submitted during this period. By end of Phase II, PCSEL prototypes will be delivered in a package considering thermal management for evaluations on laser mode quality, coherence, efficiencies, thermal stability, etc."

        "Abstract": "The Army is interested in developing high power single mode photonic crystal based surface emitting lasers with the eventual goal of coherently combining them into a very high power single mode output beam delivering power levels suitable for HEL weapons, which will be a few hundreds of kWs in a single narrow divergence diffraction limited beam. Surface emitting lasers such as VCSELs or photonic crystal surface emitting lasers (PCSEL) are extremely reliable as they don\u2019t have facet damage problem and are configurationally better suited to be able to be combined into a coherent array. PCSEL device approach has made significant progress in recent years and there are single mode products in the market of around 200mW of output power with good mode quality from some vendors, but their efficiencies are not very good. We have an approach to increase the power level and efficiency with techniques that we propose in this SBIR. Our goal will be to increase the power level of single mode devices to &gt;5W with high efficiency in the phase II of this SBIR. In phase I, we would develop the simulation tools and will design and fabricate some photonic crystal layers which can be integrated with the gain medium in phase II."

        "Abstract": "The primary objective is to\u00a0is to develop\u00a0a collaborative fire control decision aid \u2013 referred to as Centralized Fire Control Software (CFCS) - that will aggregate the data from end-users to a server on the network, utilize those data to compute the optimal engagements for each enemy, then push the results back to the individuals on the network. The result would be that Soldiers\u2019 status is pulled from the very devices that they\u2019re using to engage targets (e.g. laser rangefinders) and pushed to a central location for processing &amp; viewing, providing the chain of command with unmatched situational awareness, without requiring any further inputs from the soldier. This organic integration with fire control devices will enhance soldier lethality by minimizing the time from enemy detection to engagement by the best-positioned friendly asset.\u00a0 \u00a0 One of the central capabilities to this approach is using a technique known as Weapon Employment Zone (WEZ) analysis to compute the expected probability of hit for a shooter on a target, based upon the shooter\u2019s weapon, the current atmospheric conditions, the target\u2019s dimensions and movement. WEZ has been used heavily by SOCOM, the Army, and DHS to assess the effect of different parameters on the expected performance of small arms weapons, even being used in Afghanistan to determine enemy standoff distances. When calculated for each friendly against each enemy in the centralized database, this can be utilized as an objective measure of which friendly should be engaging which enemy.\u00a0 One innovation for the CFCS is that this WEZ technique can be utilized in\u00a0both directions of an engagement. If the enemy information includes the weaponry that the enemy possesses, nVision will utilize WEZ to compute the probability that an enemy can hit each of the friendly assets. This provides Soldiers and leaders with an objective measure of which enemy poses the greatest threat to any friendly and the leader can re-task his team members accordingly."

        "Abstract": "Software defined radios (SDRs) have redefined many areas of modern electronics, from enabling reconfigurable communications to rapid prototyping of new electronic support concepts.\u00a0 However, current implementations of SDRs are limited by the underlying electronic approaches used to realize them.\u00a0 Herein, we describe a novel photonically-enabled SDR (PESDR) that utilized the inherently broadband nature of signal generation, mixing, and routing in optics to enable extremely broadband SDRs with wide frequency tunability and deployment flexibility.\u00a0 Using optimized versions of optical modulators and photodiodes, first developed for the telecommunications industry, efficient conversion to and from the optical domain is possible and optical fiber and photonic integrated circuit routing provides low-loss, low-SWaP form factors for SDR realization.\u00a0 Using experimentally-validated injection locking techniques, PSI has been able to realize tunable optical paired sources (TOPS) that lock two laser cavities with a precise frequency offset and replicate linewidth and noise between the two lasers.\u00a0 Thus, when these two lasers, or any modulated signals deriving from these lasers, are beat together on a photodiode, a precise sub-1Hz linewidth tone is generated in the electrical domain.\u00a0 These locked lasers can then form the basis for a widely-tunable, software-defined transmit and receive channels that can be modulated, routed, and phased optically. The proposed effort leverages over $15M in past and current DoD applied research programs, which have already proven most of the critical concepts. In this proposal, we lay out a plan to implement these already proven PESDR concepts in an integrated format more suitable for deployment."

        "Abstract": "The solution that this proposal offers is the adaptation of GasTOPS\u2019 commercially proven ChipCHECK system to provide a flightline oil analysis solution for USAF platforms.\u00a0 ChipCHECK is a highly capable tool that performs quick, reliable and repeatable analysis of wear debris chip particles obtained from chip detectors removed from an engine.\u00a0 ChipCHECK brings automated laboratory capabilities to the flight line, empowering maintainers with the ability to obtain decision grade information within minutes. GasTOPS proposes to advance the technology in ChipCHECK to offer an Advanced ChipCHECK system that can analyze smaller, fine particles from oil samples. GasTOPS has completed majority of the technology research required and has developed a demonstration prototype. The ChipCHECK platform utilizes Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) for alloy identification and high-resolution digital imaging to locate and size particles.\u00a0 LIBS is a chemical analytical technology that uses short laser pulses to create micro hot-plasma ablation of a material, and then employs spectroscopic tools to analyze the target\u2019s composition. \u00a0Combining Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) with digital imaging, ChipCHECK automatically determines the alloy classification and size of each individual particle in the wear debris sample.\u00a0 As a result, ChipCHECK provides rapid, reliable, and conclusive equipment health information to the operator. The same platform is used for Advanced ChipCHECK but with modifications to achieve analysis of particles down to 5 microns (compared to &gt;100 micron chips). By analyzing each individual particle, the source of wear can be more accurately pinpointed compared to bulk oil measurements. By analyzing elemental and alloy composition, more information on wear modes such as material interactions can be obtained, improving condition assessment capabilities. GasTOPS has a partnership with Pratt &amp;Whitney Canada though which it has been commercially proven that this technique of individual oil fines analysis provides advanced notice of impending failures with oil wetted components by up to a few hundred hours at a reduced sample frequency, thereby reducing maintenance costs. Currently, this analysis is conducted as a laboratory service using Scanning Electron Microscope technology that requires samples to be shipped to the lab. The Advanced ChipCHECK system brings this capability to the flight line. Compared to chip analysis, there are a lot more particles - 100\u2019s to 1000\u2019s of fine particles - in an oil sample and therefore, the capability has been improved to analyze hundreds of particles per minute, providing timely analysis results. These results do not require subjective interpretation and will enable immediate maintenance-level decisions. The analysis process is fully automated requiring very little input from the operator."

        "Abstract": "Single molecule DNA\/RNA transport and Raman Scattering readout in a couplednanochannel\/nanopore sequencing system\nArmonica Technologies, Inc. is proposing to develop a novel, high-throughput, label-free, highly\naccurate, long-read DNA sequencing platform based on inexpensive nanoscale patterning and self-\nassembly. The platform consists of nanochannels (cross section dimensions of ~ 100 nm); tortuous\n(convoluted, 3D) nanopores formed by self-assembly of colloidal nanoparticles; nanoparticle barriers\nplaced across the nanochannels; and a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) field enhancement structure atop the\nnanochannel roof. In operation, single- stranded- or double-stranded-DNA is partially stretched into a\nlinear configuration in the nanochannels, is blocked at barriers incorporated into the channels and forced\n(by electric field) to translocate through the tortuous nanopores in the roof. The MIM structure on the roof\nlocally enhances the electromagnetic fields of applied laser sources allowing surface enhanced coherent\nanti-Stokes Raman scattering (SECARS) detection of individual bases as they pass through the\nelectromagnetic hot spots, thus providing single base sensitivity and spatial localization. The distinct\nRaman spectra of the individual bases allow label-free sequencing. Optical detection allows massively\nparallel operation since the only requirement is separation of the pores by more than an optical\nwavelength, which is easily accomplished in the fabrication. An important feature of the platform is that\nthe porous roofs allow introduction of oligonucleotides, small proteins, and DNA-binding\/DNA\nprocessing enzymes, permitting optional manipulation and modification of the DNA in the nanochannels.\nThe goals of this Phase I project are: to optimize the MIM structure for single base sensitivity and spatial\nlocalization; to demonstrate single base sensitivitySingle molecule DNA\/RNA transport and Raman scattering readoutin a coupled nanochannel\/nanopore sequencing system.\nRapid, label-free, highly accurate, long-read DNA sequencing has important implications for\ngenomic and medical applications. A novel nanostructured platform consisting of nanochannels,\ntortuous (3D convolved) nanopores, nanopore barriers and metal (plasmonic\/metamaterial)\nantennas is proposed allowing massively parallel optical readout with dramatically faster\nthroughput and improved accuracy than current technologies. Readout of the DNA bases is by\nlabel-free, surface-enhanced coherenet anti-Stokes Raman scattering, a highly specific process\nthat uniquely identifies the DNA bases including epigenetic and isotopic variations, allowing\nsequencing of cellular DNA with minimal pre-processing."

        "Abstract": "Allosteric Drug Discovery using Quantum Cascade Laserbased Anisotropic THz Microscope (QCL-ATM)\nProposal in Response to NIH\/NIGMS STTR PA-20-265\nThis STTR will result in a commercially viable instrument that will enable critical research in allosteric drugs\nand protein dynamics. To date allosteric inhibitors are largely found serendipitously. Anisotropic THz\nmicrospectroscopy (ATM) uniquely measures the long range structural vibrations which serve as a mechanism\nfor allosteric control. ATM provides a tagless means to experimentally determine allosteric target sites. There\nare NO commercial methods that provide this information currently. ATM systems used to establish the\ntechnique are not accessible to a standard biochemical lab. In this STTR we will develop a compact system for\nturnkey operation by academic and industrial researchers. This will be achieved by a collaboration of optical\nengineers and biological physicists with unique expertise required. The system requires 1) high power tunable\nTHz source; 2) THz optical system for micro spectroscopy with polarization control; 3) high sensitivity room\ntemperature detection integrated into the microspectroscopy system; and 4) easy user interface. The\nLongWave Photonics group has innovated high power compact THz sources (quantum cascade lasers, QCL\u2019s)\nand turn-key measurement systems based on these sources. The Markelz group at UB has innovated ATM. The\nsystem, QCL-ATM, will be a turnkey tabletop instrument. In phase I the QCL-ATM will be developed to directly\nprobe vibrations within molecular standards (e.g. sucrose, fructose, and glucose and the protein crystal\ntetragonal lysozyme) using polarized THz radiation within the 1.6 \u2013 4.3 THz range of our QCL source and\nmeasure the change in absorbance as the relative orientation of the crystal molecular samples and polarization\naxis is varied. Using this demonstration of an integrated QCL-ATM instrument, we will identify the optical and\nmechanical tolerances associated with the need to place both the sample and the detector entirely within the\nnear-field region of a focused THz beam as preparation for Phase II which will include measurement of the\neffect of allosteric drugs on protein vibrations and the development of an automated polarization control\nmodule and automated multi-sample platen with repeatable high-precision sample alignment to the\ninterrogating THz beam. The specific aims for Phase I are:\nAim 1. Construct and Characterize throughput QCL-ATM Microscope in the Far-field.\nAim 2. Characterize anisotropic absorbance with the QCL-ATM for molecular crystal standards.\nAim 3. Integrate near field pyroelectric detection into the QCL-ATM prototype and establish equivalence to\nexisting systems by measuring spectra of protein crystalAllosteric Drug Discovery using Quantum Cascade Laserbased Anisotropic THz Microscope (QCL-ATM)\nProposal in Response to NIH\/NIGMS STTR PA-20-265\nWe propose to develop a benchtop spectroscopic system for rapid characterization of protein structural\ndynamics based on terahertz polarimetric spectroscopy (anisotropic terahertz microscopy, or ATM). The\nunique capability of this system to reveal previously unattainable information builds on the proposer\u2019s\nprevious work by incorporating the recently developed high-power tunable terahertz source: the terahertz\nquantum cascade laser (QCL). This lower complexity system will enable more researchers to perform studies\nfor the development of allosteric drugs, as well as increase the understanding of the impact of remote small\nmolecule binding and mutation."

        "Abstract": "MDA is interested in developing single mode high power diode lasers with excellent beam quality and high efficiency and coherently combine them for high power output and use the coherently combined modules to build high power direct diode laser (HPDDL) systems capable of achieving upwards of 10-100 kW (dependent on the beam combining technique) of high output power while maintaining the beam quality to a near diffraction limited spot size (M2&lt; 1.2) in a low SWaP configuration. We propose an approach for single mode VCSELs and for coherently combining them for very high power with the eventual goal of application in the HPDDL systems. Diode laser based high power systems will be small, high efficiency (close to 70%) and much lower cost compared to current fiber laser based approaches. Princeton Innotech offers an approach for high power single mode diode lasers and coherently coupling them for multi-kW single modules. We have successfully experimented with such coherent coupling approaches in the past. In phase I, we plan to do the design and simulations for a high power single mode VCSEL and develop single mode high power VCSELs and coherently coupled arrays in phase II. We plan to further develop the high power coherently coupled modules and commercialize them in phase III. Approved for Public Release | 20-MDA-10643 (3 Dec 20)"

        "Abstract": "Systems &amp; Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC) proposes a flight hardened, miniaturized Inverse Synthetic Aperture LADAR (ISAL) for ultra-high resolution in air and space. The proposed miniature ISAL system is a revolutionary advance in 3D range and cross range accuracy for detection of targets. Four (4) system design parameters (Target LADAR Cross Section, Closing Speeds, Aperture Size to Match Optical Window Dimensions, and High Resolution Imaging at Operational Ranges) were the principal factors in the detailed flow down and allocation of system, subsystem and component design requirements that formed the detailed system design of the innovative Miniature Inverse Synthetic Aperture LADAR (ISAL). The proposed miniature LADAR uniquely combines MDA mission requirements and constraints with proven cutting edge technology to form a comprehensive solution in terms of: aperture, target RCS, laser power, Doppler, transceiver, signal\/image processing, and missile integration. The Miniature Long Range LADAR design is composed of two (2) hardened modules, which can be independently located in the missile body for ease of integration: 1) a small 5.44 x 5.57 x 5.54 inch module (with laser, transceiver and processing blocks); and 2) a tethered (pigtail connected) 5mm aperture scanner module with both field of view and field of regard scanning capabilities, optimally located with the missile\u2019s optical window. The proposed Phase II prototype flight unit will be developed through an aggressive, streamline managed program under MDA direction and with our Phase II\/III prime contractor partners, who are already actively collaborating with us on development of a multi-faceted commercialization roadmap and on future integration of the LADAR for current and planned space and missile systems.

However, high performance optical atomic clocks currently only exist in laboratory settings due to requirements of an ultra-narrow-linewidth (lt; 10 Hz) interrogation laser used as an optical flywheel for the atomic clock transition. The solution presented here for the development of an ultra-narrow linewidth laser is an extension to the initial investigations of Dr. William Loh at MIT-LL with chip-scale stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) cavities. Recent measurements conducted by the MIT-LL team have shown that chip-based photonic waveguide cavities can support ultranarrow-linewidth lasers; this effort seeks to increase the integration of necessary chip-scale components to move towards a design where the entire laser system is contained on a chip-scale device. This effort will focus on a design for chip-based SBS laser cavity with integrated frequency doubling for direct laser light generation at 674 nm for a 88Sr+ optical atomic clock. Packaging will also be designed to integrate easily with the near-infrared pump laser at 1348 nm."

        "Abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM), esp. laser AM, becomes a powerful tool to replace conventional methods due to its cost effectiveness and capability of making complex structure and composition. However, direct fabrication of optics parts is still a challenging field, mainly due to limited understanding of process control, powder fabrication, and laser melting mechanism to eliminate defects and bubbles. Statement of how this problem or situation is being addressed. Based on our patented laser AM technology and the world\u2019s first product of fs fiber laser AM, PolarOnyx proposes, for the first time, a glass AM\/SM system to develop the optimal process to overcome these difficulties and meet the requirement of X-ray fluorescence microscopy. Phase I Results. Significant breakthroughs were made: Achieved high density (&gt;99%) and excellent control for capillary structures, and filed one patent. Phase II Plan. PolarOnyx will develop and prototype nano-AM to make high quality and high resolution capillary optics. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits. In addition to the 3D AM applications (potential $44B market in 2025), material processing is another major commercial application for this project. This includes (1) Photonic device fabrications, such as waveguide, coupler, WDM, modulator, and switching; (2) all types of metal processing such as welding, cutting, annealing, and drilling; (3) semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing such as lithography, inspection, control, defect analysis and repair, and via drilling; (4) other materials processing such as rapid prototyping, desk top manufacturing, micromachining, photofinishing, embossed holograms, and grating manufacturing."

        "Abstract": "The emerging class of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials are promising candidates for non-linear optical (NLO) applications like optical limiting. In ENZ materials, large NLO effects, particularly in the infrared, have been demonstrated at much lower optical fluxes than have been shown in traditional NLO materials. The effect has been linked to the unique electric field concentration that occurs in ENZ materials near their zero permittivity frequency. In addition to producing extraordinary NLO effects, many groups have demonstrated that the property change is an ultrafast (fs) phenomena. These shared properties, ultrafast response and low threshold for NLO change, lend themselves to use in optical limiting applications, where ultrashort pulsed lasers are becoming an evermore concerning threat. During a recent Phase 1 feasibility study, Third Floor Materials demonstrated that the NLO effect in ENZ materials designed to operate in the MWIR, could be effectively leveraged by combining them with optical antenna structures. The antenna structure allows coupling to the ENZ mode from free-space and concentrates electric field intensity within the ENZ material further augmenting the NLO effect. Some of these hybrid meta-material\/ENZ structures showed better than 2 orders of magnitude limiting at a 3 \u00b5m wavelength. To extend the usefulness of the hybrid antenna\/ENZ approach, Third Floor Materials will pursue two principle objectives in the Phase 2 follow on program; an effort to broaden the response of the ENZ limiting structure across the entire MWIR (3-5 \u00b5m) and a parallel thrust designed to increase \u2018off-state\u2019 transmission. Similar to the Phase 1 study, our team will use real, measured ENZ material properties to develop a NLO FDTD model of an ENZ limiting system \u2013 and build a prototype for Army AvMC evaluation. We believe that the proposed approach will significantly expand Army understanding of ENZ materials and providing a compelling early use case in the form of an ultra-fast optical limiting solution."

The retinal images then went through a rigorous image enhancement phase, image data augmentation, and pixel normalization. Following the enhancement and augmentation processes, algorithms were developed to identify retinal abnormalities associated with laser damage. The laser \u2013induced injury detection technology in human fundus images was optimized to achieve greater than 95% accuracy. Defining the parameters including ease of use, sensitivity and specificity, a strategy to acquire FDA approval as a clinical decision support tool will be developed. Algorithms will be transitioned to develop a fully functional prototype for commercial and clinical partners in Phase III."

        "Abstract": "Atmospheric researchers seek improved hygrometry and thermometry measurements in order to improve atmospheric data sets. In particular, better spatial resolution from airborne instruments has been targeted as a goal. For jet instrumentation, measurement speeds of 50 Hz for water vapor and 100 Hz for temperature are desired. In this project, an instrument will be developed to meet the desired measurement speed for both water vapor and temperature. The foundation of the instrument will be the NSF VCSEL hygrometer which has demonstrated the required sensitivity for water vapor and has recently been upgraded to meet the desired water vapor measurement speed. An optical fast temperature measurement will be added to the instrument design by coupling a second laser beam to monitor the oxygen optical absorption. In the Phase I project, a design for an open path multipass cell with two lasers will be developed. The sensitivity and accuracy of the optical thermometry technique will be assessed. Two different variations of this measurement method will be evaluated. The results of the Phase I project will provide the design information needed to construct a Phase II jet instrument. The technology developed in this project will be useful for performing atmospheric water vapor and temperature measurements for a variety of aerial platforms \u2013 manned aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and balloons. The multilaser single optical cell approach will be applicable to many sensing applications for multiple gases."

        "Abstract": "HOE-based Augmented Reality Avionics Display System (HARADS) Luminit Government Services, LLC (LGS) in association with University of Massachusetts, proposes to do a feasibility study for an HOE-based Augmented Reality Avionics Heads Up Display System that will improve brightness, clarity of vision, enhanced visual acuity, and increase available information in the cockpit of a military aircraft compared to the flat optical glass diffusers currently used as Avionics HUD display screens.\u00a0 Luminit&apos;s own technology for producing thin transparent holographic optical elements on a continuous roll will be used for production. This product has been tried in a near-eye application - A\/R prescription eyeglasses made by a Canadian company that has now been acquired by Google. That product had limitations due to small eye box. It is not suitable for Avionics and many other uses because it was limited to near-eye application and had a small field of view.\u00a0 There is no reason that this technology should not be developed further to overcome the field of view limitation for aviation HUD displays and many other uses.\u00a0 Transition will be natural for LGS because it is a supplier of glass diffuser-based HUD display screens for many US military aircraft. LGS, in association with our research partner proposes to replace the glass diffuser screen with a mass-produced thin film with an application-specific volume hologram that would provide a bright color image with a larger eye box (field of view) on a transparent screen without obscuring view.\u00a0 This film could be mounted on a curved helmet visor or the windshield, or anywhere in between.\u00a0 There are alternatives to the diffuser-based display screens which are based on Light guides. These too are bulky, heavy, and generate a monochromatic image. The proposed thin, transparent holographic film will change the way Avionics HUD systems are designed. Multiple lenses and reflectors used in the current HUD projectors would be replaced by the holographic film, reducing system volume and weight.\u00a0 A color image would be generated by using RGB lasers, creating bright and sharp images.\u00a0 Adding a scene combiner would allow information from multiple sources to be displayed on one HUD system providing a true Augmented Reality Enhanced Flight Vision System. Luminit Government Services (LGS) seeks this Phase I funding to (a) determine the feasibility of this concept by talking to end-users and stake holders in DoD; (b) Identify specific applications and platforms in consultation with the end-users and stake holders; and (c) Determine the feasibility of adding a scene combiner such that information from multiple sources may be displayed on one HUD system.\u00a0 ."

        "Abstract": "NASA needs cost-effective high-data-rate communications and navigation knowledge for Distributed Spacecraft Missions (DSM) and small spacecraft. Our Relative Dynamics Inc. (RDI) solution is an optical communication terminal (SCOUT) using integrated, modular, scalable and future-extendable communications for small spacecraft in the DSM configuration. Each key cost-driven optical communication terminal sub-system has been carefully considered to enable a number of key cost-saving high-performance innovations into our proposed RDI SCOUT. Precision (microradian)-pointing actuator and motors are vital for optical communications. We propose lowering system complexity and cost with a new-class of high-performance ultra-high-vacuum compatible motors that are widely used in the manufacturing industry. The RDI SCOUT terminal uses an innovative small-aperture structure small spacecraft antenna (telescope). The SCOUT terminal opto-mechanical structure uses new materials with high strength-to-weight ratio that are robust against thermal deformation. The new material is low-cost, widely available, readily manufacturable and amenable to compression-molding mass production. Low-cost high-performance telecommunications integrated photonic transceiver are at the heart of the RDI SCOUT modem. RDI SCOUT will use an open data format for compatibility and interoperability with lunar communications and navigation architecture plans. RDI SCOUT incorporates dual (comm and nav) functionality to enable clock-recovery based sub-millimeter laser ranging and precision pointing-knowledge for optical navigation with sub-arcsecond accuracy. A lander or orbiter system could provide valuable calibrated navigation range\/angle data using both active terminals and passive corner-cubes. RDI will provide system engineering for DSM operational scenarios for the SCOUT terminal including planetary lander\/orbiter, planetary lander\/Earth terminal, satellite-to-satellite and satellite\/Earth terminal."

        "Abstract": "The midstream processing of rare earth elements (REE\u2019s) such as Ce, Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb, Gd and Sm are typically converted from the oxide into the fluoride or chloride, and then reduced using metallothermic reduction or electrolysis. This entire midstream process for production of REE\u2019s is currently outsourced, with little to no commercial processors in the United States and nearly 95% of the market owned by China. Since the reopening of the Mountain Pass mine in 2018, bastnaesite ore is once again being mined in the U.S., however, it must be shipped out after beneficiation and concentration efforts in order to be refined into the oxide, and ultimately reduced into the metal form. For this reason, Terves has proposed to convert existing magnesium foundry capacity to create a domestic semi-continuous rare earth master alloy production operation. This proposed project will look at gadolinium metal production on the lab scale with a high purity (99.9%), that will run in conjunction with other Terves efforts to help accelerate the expansion to a domestic REE mid stream producer in the US. The semi-continuous process to produce high purity gadolinium with purities up to 99.9% will create a domestic source for the chosen rare earth metal that is used in the production of specialty defense equipment such as sonar, radar, and lasers, as well as commercial applications such as contrast agents for patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."

        "Abstract": "Project Summary:\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Low dose chest computed\ntomography (CT) screening programs that target high-risk individuals can reduce lung cancer-specific mortality\nby 20% and overall mortality by 6.9%. There is a growing movement to implement this life saving screening into\nroutine practice, with endorsements from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the American Thoracic\nSociety, and the American College of Chest Physicians, and a willingness from payers to provide reimbursement.\nYet, numerous challenges still exist to realize early detection and improved outcomes for lung cancer, including:\na) how to diagnosis lung cancer patients with indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs); b) how to determine\nrecurrence after therapy; and c) how to position biomarker use prior or alongside chest CT screening to decrease\nthe cost and rates of false positive tests. The availability of a rapid, high sensitivity detection method to improve\nthe quantification of biomarkers has the potential to revolutionize management of patients with IPNs.\nUnder this Phase I STTR, we propose to take the next logical steps toward commercial translation of our novel\nand patented technologies, the free-solution assay (FSA) and the compensated interferometric reader (CIR) that\nhas been shown to potentially improve IPN diagnosis. The FSA-CIR methodology is potentially transformative\nwith respect to biomedical research and medicine, representing the only solution-phase, label-free molecular\ninteraction measurement methodology with sensitivity comparable to, or better than, fluorescence, and\ncompatible with a wide range of complex matrices. These properties have enabled FSA-CIR to be used to\naddress previously challenging or intractable applications ranging from enhanced lung cancer detection, as\nproposed here, to improved in-vitro in-vivo correlations for first in human dosing, to the rapid quantification of low\nabundance chemicals in human samples, including neonatal opioids in urine and chemical nerve agents in urine\nand serum.Translation of Interferometric-based Free-solution Assay Methodology for Lung Cancer\nDiagnosis\nProject Narrative:\nDiagnosis of lung cancer presents a significant challenge, resulting in morbidity and management costs of $28\nbillion\/year in the U.S., particularly for patients with indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). Here, we show\nthat when applying a new test for measuring a blood-based circulating tumor marker to a 225 patient cohort, it\nis possible to significantly improve patient stratification and diagnostic potential of the biomarker. The proposed\napproach is patented and commercially viable, capitalizing on the increased performance of a mix-and-read test\nthat is rapid, label-free, requires only a drop of serum and is enabled by simple diode-laser based reader."

        "Abstract": "This proposal addresses subtopic 9.6.01, Low-cost Oceanic and Atmospheric Sensors and Observing Systems. It is proposed that two instruments for measuring atmospheric aerosols be commercialized to operate automatically and routinely. Both instruments have been used in research settings for many years and share several aspects of technology. They could both be commercialized with significant advantages in cost and performance over currently available instruments.\nThe first is the CLidar which measures aerosol profiles and also operates as a star-photometer to measure aerosol optical depth (AOD). Visibility and cloud ceiling are directly calculated from the data collected. The CLidar is currently limited to twilight and nighttime conditions but use of an infrared camera and laser may allow daytime operation. \nThe second instrument is an imaging polar nephelometer (IPN) that has been patented by the principle\ninvestigator. The IPN gives a detailed in-situ measurement, day and night, of scattered light from aerosols. The IPN measures the angular dependence of the scattered light. There are many commercial integrating nephelometers available but much information is lost when only the total scattered light is measured. The IPN has an excellent potential for measuring detailed aerosol properties relating to the aerosol size distribution, composition and shape."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is faster and accurate detection of Salmonella species in food processing plants. Salmonella bacteria are the most frequently reported cause of foodborne illness. Food contamination in processing facilities can lead to serious public health problems as well as costly recalls of millions of food units. Rapid and accurate sensing technology is currently lacking for definitive detection of Salmonella in food-processing plants, which delays initiation of appropriate control measures and increases the likelihood of spreading contamination and foodborne illnesses to consumers. This technology will enable more frequent testing throughout the entire manufacturing process at reduced costs. It is fully expected that this technology could be applied to the detection of other pathogens. The proposed project will create and test a rapid (20 minutes), hand-held, sensitive (1 bacteria cell per milliliter) platform to enable food-processing facilities to detect Salmonella on site. The innovation of this technology lies in the ability to avoid bacterial enrichment (22 to 48 hours to allow bacteria to grow), while still sensitively and selectively detecting Salmonella species. The device uses a testing cartridge to bring bacteria directly to a detection surface, which consists of graphene printed or scribed on a test-strip and subsequently functionalized with Salmonella-specific antibodies. Unique laser processing induces a 3D-structured surface at the nanoscale level in graphene that becomes highly conductive for biosensing and for antibody attachment, which are desirable properties for enabling low detection limits and increasing test sensitivity. These technologies can be combined into a portable platform to make a user-friendly handheld biosensor and displaying quantitative counts of bacteria. The integrated platform (test strip and cartridge) will be designed to interface with existing portable electrical readers in much the same fashion that diabetics monitor blood glucose levels at home with a blood test strip that connects to a portable reader with a digital display. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The main objective of this Phase I project is to fully demonstrate the feasibility of developing Robust Isolation for Vibration Abating (RIVA), suitable for integration in an optical transceiver, to reject high frequency base disturbance by at least 50 dB. The proposed RIVA will have integrated launch locks and latching mechanism with a robust performance. Specifically, RIVA will be applicable to long-range optical telecommunications.nbsp; RIVA will reduce angular errors from vibration on low mass, high performance, laser beam control assemblies. While this project is focused on space version of RIVA, eventually, our solution will have two additional variants designed for a particular operating condition and platform, i.e., Ground and Air. It will meet qualifications of extreme shock and vibration attenuation during non-operating period and mitigates high frequency vibrations during laser operations while minimizing its weight meet requirements. Our innovative solution offers low size, weight, and power (SWaP) with improved efficiency, reliability, and robustness as related to its function, high frequency isolation.nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;RIVA will utilize ShockTech proprietary elastomeric formulas which have been space-qualified and deployed upon NASA spacecraft. In fact, these same elastomeric formulas were used to protect the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) instrument, used in the InSight mission under NASArsquo;s Discovery program, from vibration and loads experienced during its travel from Earth to the Martian surface in 2018."

        "Abstract": "Advanced instrumentation and sensing methods are the key factor in the determination of many climate science research problems. Current sensing instrumentation is not fast enough to solve the problem of measuring temperature and water vapor properties on airborne platforms where small spatial scale sensing is needed due to turbulent fluctuations in the atmosphere. The opportunity exploited in this Phase I STTR proposal is that a laser-based diagnostic system for atmospheric temperature and water concentration measurements developed around a fast speed digital signal processor is capable of providing fast and accurate measurements needed for airborne platforms. Our innovation is HALOS \u2013 High Altitude Laser Optical Sensor which will perform high-speed assessment of water concentration in the Troposphere via an Aircraft mounted platform. HALOS will implement a new and unique mid-infrared (MIR) quantum cascade laser (QCL) of the distributed feedback variety (DFB) powered by a 100 kHz rep rate ramp modulated current profile which enables spectral profiling. Laser emissions will be directed into an open cavity white cell before the attenuated beam is collected on a Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT) photodiode. HALOS will afford probing a large span of water vapor\u2019s 6.3 \u00b5m absorption feature without the need for moving parts. The laser and other components of HALOS will be driven by a multicore (8x C66x + 4x ARM A15 cores) digital signal processor (DSP) (Texas Instruments 66AK2H14) operating at 1.4GHz. The DSP will enable realtime processing of spectral data, and signal enhancement routines while also providing data output via a standard bus and logging to HALOS\u2019 onboard removeable memory card. HALOS features high data output rates in the kHz range and offers spatial resolution on the order of 25 cm. Public benefits include high accuracy, real time data for weather forecasting systems. Future applications include indoor air quality monitoring for the semiconductor fabrication industry."

        "Abstract": "The science and technology of structuring and miniaturization of material by lithography have been constantly advancing to develop nanoscale and single-digit-micron-scale devices revolutionizing the world with smaller and more efficient transistors, microelectromechanical systems, and metamaterial devices. However, these technologies are based on planar approaches, limiting products to two dimensions. To further this advancement, new and advanced lithographic processes are needed that can extensively pattern materials at the nano\/microscale level in three-dimensions. To address this need for new, scalable, rapid, and affordable large-area lithographic approaches to nano\/microfabrication in three dimensions, an innovative low-power high-throughput volumetric lithographic system is proposed. The proposed nano\/microfabrication in 3D is based on a highly parallel micro-objective lens array design that utilizes a proposer-developed electrically tunable phase-matched liquid crystal microlens array and low-cost commercial off-the-shelf components. Specifically, the innovation in the use of the tunable liquid crystal microlens array and the Talbot grid scanning approach will enable the proposed system to provide a highly parallel, direct laser writing, three-dimensional lithography and overcome the limitations of current direct laser writing approaches, and to provide simultaneous (&gt;10,000) submicron focus spots (voxels), high scan speed (&gt;100,000 voxels\/second),largeworkingdistance(&gt;1cm),andlowwritepower(1 mm), volumetric structures as specified in the project goal. In Phase II, development of a prototype of a volumetric lithographic system that will meet the customer requirements, and demonstration of its capability for low-power, high-throughput volumetric lithography are planned. The proposed rapid, affordable, large-area scalable volumetric lithography approach will enable a multitude of applications ranging from micro-optics, metamaterials, subwavelength optical devices, biomedical tissue scaffolding and imaging, and other tasks unserved by planar lithography or current direct laser writing approaches."

        "Abstract": "To address the MDA need for an innovative, non-destructive evaluation (NDE) process for rapidly evaluating the suitability of 3D printed production metal parts, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (Intellisense) proposes to develop a new Nondestructive Internal Flaw Detector (NEILL) system based on ultrasonic thermography augmented by advanced signal processing optimized for application on 3D printed metal parts. Specifically, the innovative use of thermography along with laser ultrasonic methods enables a noncontact, non-destructive method for evaluating the defects in 3D printed metal parts. In addition, the system uses enhanced image processing to process and improve defect extraction allowing determination of location, size, and depth of voids and intra-granular impurities. Correlating the ultrasonic information and thermal information results provides a better understanding of the overall internal structure of the target. As a result, the NEILL system offers accurate, non-destructive inclusion of an integrity assessment in the additive manufacturing process to allow corrective actions to be performed to prevent failure of a part in service and to certify parts for use either during or immediately after manufacturing. During Phase I, Intellisense plans to assemble and test a proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate feasibility of the NEILL system detecting internal voids and defects in common aerospace material that result in lower than expected failure resistance or fatigue life. The results will be documented and correlation between NDE results and ultimate strength will be described along with plans for Phase II. In Phase II, Intellisense will demonstrate the ability to detect internal flaws in multiple large complex parts with assorted internal flaws to demonstrate the correlation between NDE results and the ultimate strength at failure with high statistical confidence, as well as the ability to validate the quality of prototype flight hardware with the same confidence as CT scans.

        "Abstract": "To address the Navy\u2019s need for an intelligent laser-based fiber optic (FO) system for Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) of Naval platforms, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (Intellisense) proposes to develop a new Intelligent Fiber Optic Laser-based Interrogation System (IFOLIS) based on a cost-effective laser, a tunable modulator and filter, and distributed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors combined with an artificial intelligence (AI) processing algorithm. Specifically, the innovative design of a tunable laser and AI algorithm with feedback control enables high strain sensitivity detection of low amplitude, high frequency, and short duration ultrasonic bursts of energy generated by growing cracks or other sources. It achieves strain sensitivity of 100 femto-strain\/sqrt(Hz) in the frequency range from 10 kHz to 1 MHz, with thermal drift compensation through the AI algorithm and feedback control. Being intelligent, IFOLIS is reliable and capable of continuous structural health monitoring with high resolution (from micro to macro scales). Based on and benefiting from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) standard optical communication components, it is cost-effective. As a result, IFOLIS can power, sense, and communicate between a centralized health management unit and all the different nodes, sensors, and actuators of a platform-wide distributed FO network. In Phase I, Intellisense will demonstrate the feasibility of IFOLIS through design and development of an IFOLIS proof-of-concept prototype and will develop prototype plans for Phase II. In Phase II, Intellisense plans to develop and demonstrate the IFOLIS prototype and work with the Navy for laboratory testing and user assessments."

        "Abstract": "To address the Navy\u2019s need for cognitive science-based display technology that maximizes high-energy laser (HEL) weapon human-machine interface (HMI), Intellisense Systems, Inc. proposes to develop a new Directed Energy Decision-Aid and HMI Enhanced Adaptive Display (DED-AHEAD). The proposed display technology combines closed-loop HMI analysis and visual enhancement based on modern human cognitive science. It is designed for improving operator focus and situational awareness, coupled with low cognitive load symbology improvements. Specifically, the innovation in closed-loop analysis and display enhancements to reduce cognitive load and increase operator effectiveness will enable Intellisense to generate a unique HMI style guide for use by the Navy to translate into tactical code. In Phase I Intellisense will develop a concept of an HEL weapon HMI through analysis and modeling of the DED-AHEAD proposed display architecture for simulation and evaluation of closed-loop optimization of the HMI. Intellisense\u2019s strategic partner will provide further insights for HEL system integration, leading to the feasibility demonstration of the technology that compares the baseline HEL HMI with the new DED-AHEAD enhanced HMI. Derivation of capabilities of the surrogate display hardware prototype will be demonstrated in Phase II. In Phase II, Intellisense also plans to fully develop a prototype of the DED-AHEAD derived HMI concept for HEL weapon operator stations with surrogate computer hardware and displays using nontactical code emulating tactical displays. The Phase II development will culminate in finalized specifications for the HMI style guide, which will be demonstrated using the surrogate hardware displays to government subject matter experts and program managers."

Specifically, the innovation in variable frequency phase locked loops will enable the system to provide all necessary laser frequencies for LPAI with a simplified architecture compared to current laser sources. As a result, this system offers up to three laser frequencies at once with an output power &gt;50 mW: a master laser locked to a saturated absorption feature of the Rb D2 line, and the other two locked to the master with offsets ranging from 0 to 5 GHz with a volume 50,000 hr. In Phase II, Intellisense plans to build and test a prototype that will meet the critical requirements and test the resistance of this prototype to shock and vibration."

        "Abstract": "To address the Navy\u2019s need for a multispectral target and scene projector to evaluate a gimbaled sensor and the performance of tracking algorithms in a spectrally complex environment, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (Intellisense) proposes to develop a new Multispectral Target and Scene Projector (MULTEP) based on an innovative multispectral modular design integrated with illumination sources, high dynamic range spatial light modulators (SLMs), and vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) arrays. Each module covers a specific spectral region, such as ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), shortwave infrared (SWIR), midwave infrared (MWIR), or longwave infrared (LWIR). The multispectral images from multiple modules are combined by dichroic beam combiners (DBCs). The test scenes from each spectral module are collimated and projected through projection optics. While the SLMs and light sources are used to simulate UV and VIS scenery, the VACNT arrays excited by visible laser images are used for SWIR to LWIR scene simulations. Using multispectral image coregistration, the images of each band are projected to the same angular position, achieving a multispectral image on the sensor. Each module can be independently (simultaneously or separately) controlled or adjusted (in spatial resolution, spectral content\/signature of image and its radiometry, trajectory, etc.), making the system reconfigurable and scalable (i.e., scalable in number of spectral channels and scene resolutions in each channel). As a result, MULTEP will generate and project targets and scenes that dynamically vary the mixture of LWIR, MWIR, SWIR, VIS, and UV emissions, simulating scenery in each band, including the image\u2019s angular size, and follow a pre-programmed trajectory while dynamically moving in relation to the primary target. Hence, MULTEP enables the evaluation of a gimbaled sensor and the performance of tracking algorithms in a spectrally complex environment with dynamic targets with signatures comprised of LWIR, MWIR, SWIR, VIS, and UV bands as well as an illuminated background emitting in the UV and\/or VIS bands. In Phase I, Intellisense will demonstrate the feasibility of MULTEP through design and development of a MULTEP proof-of-concept prototype and will develop prototype plans for Phase II. In Phase II, Intellisense plans to develop and demonstrate the MULTEP prototype and work with the Navy for laboratory testing and user assessments."

        "Abstract": "Narrow line width fiber lasers have great potential for high-power directed energy applications. The beams of multiple fibers can be combined using spectral or coherent methods for scaling to high power levels. To successfully achieve goals of multi-kW fiber laser system scaling, accurate methods are needed to predict the performance of individual fibers and how their performance is affected by fiber properties. In response to this need, our team is developing a comprehensive physics-based fiber laser analysis tool. The resulting product will be a user-friendly software package that uses as-drawn fiber properties as inputs and provides predictions of the time-dependent kinetics, pump absorption, laser light propagation, and thermal field along the fiber. During Phase I, we developed a first prototype of a high-fidelity laser analysis tool to incorporate experimentally observed distributions of fiber refractive index and doping, and we performed parametric sensitivity analyses. In Phase II, we will implement upgraded physical models and numerical methods and deliver a user-friendly software package. We will validate and verify the software through comparisons to selected literature results, reduced-order models, and experimental data. Approved for Public Release | 20-MDA-10643 (3 Dec 20)"

        "Abstract": "Free-space optical communication (FSOC) provides a much higher modulation bandwidth than RF communication. Narrow optical beams provide enhanced security, although they are much more sensitive than RF to platform disturbances and the atmosphere. Turbulence causes beam wander, broadening, and breakup (scintillation) on the transmit laser and dynamic aberrations at the receiver, especially when the path&apos;s refractive structure parameter is large. Our approach in Phase I is based on our experience in developing the PROPS and DELTA turbulence sensors, modeling\/forecasting turbulence and extinction from environmental measurements and terrain, laser flight testing, and adaptive FSOC research. We propose to integrate an FSOC performance model into our existing SHaRE toolbox, use it and wave-optics simulations to determine an optimally adaptive FSOC keying scheme, and explore its performance in the presence of platform-based and external disturbances for a variety of relevant link geometries and practical measurements."

In this proposed project, the surface emission architecture will first be optimized with numerical modeling for optimal efficiency and near diffraction limited output.\u00a0 The numerical modeling will be verified through proof of concept verification of the proposed device.\u00a0 The potential for power scaling will also be explored with the goal of achieving at least 20 W of output power in continuous operation."

Current fabrication technologies do not have good compatibility with other electronic components or cannot manufacture the supercapacitor in a small form factor. Consequently, most supercapacitor are developed on an isolated chip and then soldiered onto the electronic board. This method adds significant weight, large aerial footprint, and significantly fabrication cost and labor. Therefore, a supercapacitor design and manufacturing method needs to be developed that directly integrate miniature supercapacitors on-chip and which is compatible with current CMOS technology."

        "Abstract": "Super-resolution imaging provides the ability to measure (i.e., resolve) objects that are smaller than the ~200 nanometer resolution limit of visible light. This can provide more detailed examinations into cellular metabolism and subcellular compartments, potentially leading to new advances in renewable energy production from microbial and plant sources. To date, however, super-resolution has been restricted to fixed (i.e., not living) samples processed in a particular manner, while single-molecule (SM) live imaging is possible only for very limited periods of time due to photodamage incurred by high-intensity illumination. Furthermore, out-of-focus light restricts the depth within a sample at which SM imaging can be performed. This STTR Phase I project aims to combine SM super-resolution microscopy with a patented Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) technology that uniquely enables the use of high-resolution objective lenses previously incompatible with LSFM. LSFM is both a more photon-efficient method of illumination (less photodamage) and an effective means of limiting out-of-focus light by only illuminating the in-focus specimen plane. While the technology that forms the basis of this proposal is the only LSFM technology that is natively compatible with the high-resolution lenses necessary for SM imaging, proper fluorophore behavior in SM imaging requires significantly more laser power than traditional LSFM demands. In order to achieve these higher powers, the illumination path needs to be paired with stronger lasers and re-engineered to generate a narrower light sheet, which will concentrate power currently wasted outside the field of view. This will be achieved using a series of custom focusing mirrors. The proposed work will involve the optical design and prototyping work necessary to establish a functional prototype, as well as evaluation of its performance using a variety of biological samples. In future work, this proof of concept will be leveraged for entry into the market as a first-of-its-kind super-resolution light sheet instrument. The illumination method of the system will increase the longevity of samples, broaden compatibility of fluorophores with SM imaging (including low-abundance labels and metabolic probes), and enable super-resolution of structures deeper in cells, thereby opening up new experimental space for SM imaging."

        "Abstract": "Spectral Sensor Solutions LLC (S3) and our subcontractor, Texas Tech University, are pleased to submit this proposal in response to the NASA SBIR Phase I solicitation, subtopic S5.03 Accelerating NASA Science and Engineering through the Application of Artificial Intelligence. In Phase I we propose to apply modern machine learning (ML) methods to enable real-time flagging of integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) lidar measurements using ancillary data collected inflight. In addition, during Phase I, we propose to leverage significant improvements in research forecast models to build tools to extract data relevant to same-day flight planning tools and inputs required for low-uncertainty, inflight, preliminary data analysis of IPDA measurements. In Phase II we will use ML methods to score the quality of research forecast inputs to preliminary column mole fraction (CMF) retrievals. The IPDA lidars used in the Atmospheric Carbon Transport - America NASA Earth Venture Suborbital Program, the Multi-functional Fiber Laser Lidar (MFLL) and the High Altitude Lidar Observatory (HALO), will provide the primary data for these retrievals. Ultimately, the goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of using high-resolution rapid refresh (HRRR) models to enable improved NASA airborne science mission planning and to demonstrate application of the derived thermodynamic variables to near-real-time CMF retrievals with low uncertainty. Tools developed in this SBIR will provide a significant improvement for future airborne science missions in general through enhanced tools for flight planning, resulting in maximization of science return per flight hour. Additionally, science campaigns using active remote gas monitoring systems will be significantly enhanced through the ability to provide low uncertainty retrievals of column mole fractions for the gas of interest in near-real-time from the remote measurements versus the weeks- or months-long lag currently available for these systems."

        "Abstract": "This project will demonstrate a novel approach to achieve rapid (1 second or faster) and sensitive (ppb level) detection of molecular hydrogen, H2. The monitor will be based upon the rapid and quantitative conversion of molecular hydrogen to water vapor in ambient air over a hot catalyst. The resulting water vapor can be detected with a variety of fast and sensitive water vapor monitoring technologies \u2013 for example, laser spectroscopy or non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) spectroscopy. Normally, the signal from ambient water vapor would exceed the hydrogen-derived water signal. Unaddressed, this would greatly limit the utility of this approach. However, we will employ novel sampling schemes to overcome this challenge. These innovations will extract the desired hydrogen signal while suppressing the undesired ambient water signal. These proprietary schemes are presented in detail in the Phase I proposal. This proposal is directly responsive to the request in sub-topic 27.c for \u201cnew sensing tools, both fixed and mobile and for either remote or close-in detection.\u201d Multiple versions of this instrument that address different scenarios are envisioned, but all will utilize the novel sampling approach developed during Phase I. At one end of the spectrum of industrial applications, this technology will enable inexpensive portable leak detectors for close-in or near field leak detection with precision of ~1 ppm. At the other end, a highly sensitive hydrogen monitor, with precision at the ppb level, will be configured for the remote or far field detection of leaks measured at long distance in a moving platform. During Phase I a prototype hydrogen monitor will be built and tested using a commercial water vapor monitor as the detection module. A prototype hydrogen to water conversion system and a prototype proprietary ambient water vapor suppression system will be constructed. Conversion of hydrogen to water vapor over a hot catalyst is a mature technique with little risk to the project\u2019s success, but in Phase I its time response and conversion efficiency under appropriate flow conditions will be demonstrated as will its capability to suppress methane oxidation for some applications. Testing of the ambient water vapor suppression system will be the most crucial Phase I task. A successful Phase I will lead to a Phase II project that will consist of developing detailed designs and realistic demonstrations of various versions of this technology aimed at specific markets. A product line is envisioned ranging from portable near-field hydrogen leak detectors with adequate sensitivity in the price range of 30 k$ (before scaling to mass production), to highly sensitive, high speed monitors with prices ranging between 100 k$ and 150 k$ before scaling to mass production. Part of the Phase II effort will be to carefully explore the hydrogen monitoring opportunities that are likely to arise in the rapidly growing hydrogen economy, and to tailor commercialization towards those markets."

        "Abstract": "Electronic denial is a critical capability when combating new and evolving threats including UAS engagement and surveillance, agile rockets, artillery, and mortars, and long-range missiles. The current systems relying upon direct generation of radio and microwave frequencies require large and complex architectures and provide limited frequency tunability for high-power narrow-band outputs. The long wavelengths used in these systems limit the directionality and focusing capabilities at extended ranges, reducing the total electromagnetic intensity on target. In contrast, propagation of optical frequencies enables much more concentrated energy deposition, especially with recent advances in adaptive atmospheric compensation. While continuous-wave lasers are the primary optical source of directed energy technology, there is merit in pursuing the capabilities of high-average power, high-peak power pulsed optical sources. Pulsed lasers are capable of delivering localized, tunable, and highly-concentrated RF bursts directly to the target. Their high intensities facilitate plasma generation either on the target itself or in the surrounding media; subsequent modulation of this plasma by following pulses results in controllable RF waveforms, which have been shown to possess single-shot denial of small drones and robust circuit disruption. The burst-mode lasers developed at Spectral Energies are ideal candidates for scaling this promising capability to practical, multi-platform realizations."

The SWERVI platform will be an integrated-photonics subsystem for the calibration of current and next-generation astronomical spectrographs with precision-radial velocity (PRV) sensitivity lt;10\u202fcm\/s. The proposed module will use nonlinear nanophotonic waveguides to efficiently and controllably broaden the optical spectrum of an input frequency comb laser, to serve as the broadband calibration source in PRV measurements. Our key innovations will build on our Phase 1 work to include: experimental demonstration of multi-stage coherent broadening in tantala (Ta2O5) photonic circuits, two-channel output to support self-referencing of the frequency comb, andnbsp;fully packaged modules in a robust enclosurenbsp;for use in demanding environments. When coupled with a high-repetition-rate comb source, the SWERVI system will enable new PRV calibration sources with spectral coverage virtually anywhere in the visible and near-infrared, while reducing power consumption and complexity through photonic integration. This system addresses a critical technology gap for extreme PRV measurements to detect and study exoplanets. Beyond PRV instrumentation, further development and commercialization of this nonlinear integrated-photonics platform will enable new capabilities in terrestrial and space-borne applications, such as atmospheric spectroscopy, precision timing and navigation, and optical communications."

        "Abstract": "In recent years, powerful X-ray light source facilities such as synchrotrons and free electron lasers have been developed for studying the structure of matter down to the atomic scale, and to create \u201cmolecular movies\u201d of chemical reaction on time scales of picoseconds down to femtoseconds. Many fields of science and applied science are informed by these techniques and their results power the world economy. To push the knowledge frontier of these sciences, X-ray sources are being continually upgraded for properties like higher intensity and better focus. As a consequence, they come up against the limits of existing X-ray detectors to record intense X-ray pulses, and therefore they require new, advanced detectors with which to record their X-ray patterns. This grant will use newly-developed high end detector sensing electronics, and with them design and create a new high-resolution pixelated detector for taking high speed pictures of X-ray patterns. The new detector has the capability to integrate signals from X-ray patterns, and record them at orders of magnitude higher rate than is possible with existing commercial detector products used at these facilities. This detector is also a perfect companion for free electron laser sources, which have few suitable options for measuring the near-instantaneous X-ray diffraction and scattering patterns. The Phase II project builds on the success of the previous Phase I project, the fruits of which were: the development of new detector sensing electronics, the manufacture of a working small test detector, a test of operating at low temperature which showed how to remove the image noise, development of readout and image display software, and a design strategy for the Phase II project of scaling up the detector to the necessary size for world class research experiments. The excellent data quality produced by this new detector will inform many branches of science utilizing the diffraction, scattering, and microscopy techniques at these X-ray facilities. Researchers will be able to develop useful new technologies, such as improve aerospace materials with stress and strain measurements, design faster and lower power computer chips, or even determine the structure and kinetics of biomolecules, leading to advances in medicine and pharmaceuticals."

        "Abstract": "The fundamental limiting factor limiting Free Electron Lasers brightness is the electron source, or photoinjector. Next generation X-ray Free Electron Lasers and electron instruments will strongly depend on the breakthrough advances in electron sources. One possible solution to improve brightness is to use specifically shaped ultraviolet pulses to excite the photocathode in order to shape the electron cloud properly for injection into the accelerator. Ultraviolet spatio-temporal ultrafast pulse measurement is needed to develop the needed pulse shapes. In this SBIR\/STTR, we will develop new methods for temporal and spatio-temporal measurement of ultraviolet ultrafast laser pulses to support the development of laser pumped ultra-bright electron sources. These techniques need to provide the dynamic range and have the signal-to-noise ratios needed to provide the guidance needed to properly shape the photocathode driving pulses. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed techniques for temporal and spatio- temporal measurement of deep UV ultrafast laser pulses. Dynamic range and sensitivity will be examined as well as the accuracy and precision of the techniques. Our ultraviolet ultrafast laser pulse measurement technology will provide badly needed diagnostics in commercial markets. Deep ultraviolet ultrafast pulses are used in both scientific instruments and the semiconductor industry. This SBIR project will also develop new technologies for telecommunications applications."

        "Abstract": "Ultrafast lasers are used or proposed for use in many areas of accelerator applications; for example, drivers for novel accelerator concepts for future colliders and in the generation, manipulation, and xray seeding of electron beams. Endtoend modeling of spatiotemporal pulse propagation is vital for current and next generation sources. Model verification is a key tool in model refinement. Currently, no complete spatiotemporal pulse measurement technique is offered on the market. High energy ultrafast laser beamlines are large devices with limited points available for pulse sampling. Accurate spatiotemporal measurements at these locations are critical for reliable modeling of pulse interactions in downstream locations. In this SBIR, we will develop new methods to make rapid spatiotemporal measurements which are integrated with 4D pulse propagation software. In Phase I, we demonstrated our proposed techniques for the spatiotemporal measurement of ultrafast laser pulses anywhere within an optical system. The accuracy and precision of our measurement technique was demonstrated. Models of optical systems were verified by mathematically propagating spatiotemporally measured inputs and comparing them with spatiotemporally measured outputs. Multiple models were tested, including commercial software using scalar, paraxial propagation, and customdeveloped software for vectorfield propagation. In Phase II, we will develop a prototype system that will seamlessly incorporate 4D mathematical propagation with spatiotemporal pulse measurement to predict and verify pulse behavior throughout an optical system. We will demonstrate this technology by modeling and measuring the spatiotemporal effects of amplifier temperature gradients, nonlinearity, and gain on an ultrafast pulse. Our 4D ultrafast laser pulse measurement technology will provide badly needed diagnostics in commercial markets. Application areas include scientific research, manufacturing, and the semiconductor industry."

These manufacturing challenges are exacerbated by free-form optical designs that relynbsp;on difficult multi-axis sub-aperture machining or tool rastering and protracted 3-D surface characterization techniques.nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; The technical objectives in this project open the opportunity for low-cost, free-form optics manufacturing by integrating an in-situ optical metrology system into a newly-developed laser-based machining tool to achieve nanometer (x, y, z) root mean square precision over a 160 cm^2 glass workpiece. The metrology system will overcome the current challenges of characterizing free-forms with large spherical departure (gt;1mm), small inflection points, and asymmetries.nbsp; The approach of measuring optical properties, in contrast to the ndash; as usual ndash;nbsp;physical shape, will also ensure the parts are functionally deployable. The overall project outcome will be an optics manufacturing technology akin to the significance of CNC machining ushering in a new generation of rapid, cost-effective, and high-precision manufacturing that will be transformative to the optics industry.nbsp;"

        "Abstract": "The constantly improved and upgraded X-ray Free Electron Lasers (FEL) have been opening the doors for many scientific frontiers in biology, chemistry and material science, such as structural dynamics, matter at extreme conditions and nanostructure imaging. Incision structural probes, such as sub-picosecond time- resolved x-ray spectroscopy and diffraction, time-resolving chemical reactions, femtosecond X-ray\/optical cross- correlation diagnostics, and the associated synchronization of the FEL with separate optical lasers are keys to these sciences. However, the lack of suitable ultrafast detectors covering X-rays to Vis-NIR has been preventing\/limiting such studies. The Hamamatsu G4176-03 ultrafast Metal-Semiconductor-Metal (MSM) photodetector, which is GaAs- based, is a potential solution, but was recently discontinued. A replacement with equivalent or better performance is thus needed as currently called for by the DOE. Brimrose Technology Corporation proposes the development of a picosecond photodetector based on Cadmium Magnesium Telluride (CdMgTe) single crystal that is sensitive to both optical and x-ray pulses for coarse timing in Free Electron Laser Applications. Our goal is to successfully produce a photodetector based on in-house grown CdMgTe that has potential of exhibiting better detector performance, while having similar form factor\/packaging to the Hamamatsu G4176-03 ultra-fast MSM photodetector. Brimrose can achieve this goal using our vast experience and expertise in II-VI materials technology, including CdMgTe. Recently, our collaborator on this subject, Prof. Roman Sobolewski of the University of Rochester (UR), NY, has demonstrated that Brimrose grown CdMgTe has exhibited sub-picosecond optical response to femtosecond laser pulses and would also be very sensitive to picosecond x-ray pulses, as well. We now would like to continue our CdMgTe photodetector development effort, to optimize its performance, as well as develop the recipe for reliability and commercial scalability. The combination of Brimrose and UR forms a strong team with vast experience in photodetector materials growth, expertise in fabricating proposed devices, pertinent characterization facilities and commercialization experience, promising success to meet the objectives of the proposed program. The successful outcome of this Phase 1 research is a CdMgTe photodetector that has similar form factor\/packaging and performance equal to or better than that of the Hamamatsu G4176-03 Ultrafast MSM photodetector, thus enabling the coarse timing in FEL applications. Subsequently, all applications that rely on ultrafast timing of FEL, such as femtosecond X-ray\/optical cross-correlation diagnostics, will benefit, especially in biology, chemistry and material science. Hence, there is a tremendous potential for widespread commercialization of the materials and devices that will be developed during this program. Additionally, at this time, ultrafast Cd1-xMgxTe photodetector materials are not available commercially. We hope to develop a domestic source for this material as an outcome of this research. We feel that our expertise in commercialization can make this a reality."

        "Abstract": "With the goal of enabling rapid and comprehensive standoff sensing of chemical compounds, we proposed to develop a compact, integrated, optical sensing LIBS + LITE instrument with high spectroscopic information content for in situ reconnaissance and characterization of surface contamination mapping and identification. This proposed LIBS + LITE instrument is an integrated system with a LIBS + LITE detector unit carried by an unmanned aerial system (UAS) whose the flight path will be synchronized with the vehicle-based excitation laser beam to probe the operational surface. LIBS + LITE is a novel concept that incorporates a suite of two advanced optical spectroscopy technologies: UV-visible-NIR (UVN) Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and an additional groundbreaking capability of a mid-IR laser-induce Thermal Emission (LITE) spectroscopy. LITE is the first and only mid-IR emission spectroscopy without the need of any sample preparation that can be used as a rapid, in situ, and standoff chemical characterization probe in the field applications. Combined with multi-elemental analysis of UVN LIBS emission, this novel system has the potential to offer a rapid, comprehensive, and robust chemical characterization of surface targets of from standoff distance. Phase I studies clearly show LIBS+ LITE as a viable rapid in-situ analytical tool for offering sub-millisecond analysis and high specificity and sensitivity of Army reconnaissance mission related chemical compounds. The intense and distinctive LIBS + LITE spectral features of the surface hazardous contaminants, such as chemical warfare agent (CWA) simulants DMMP and Malathion, can be readily and unambiguously distinguished from the various background signals. The phase I studies estimated the possible detection limit of this proposed optical technology to be in the range of 0.6-6 g\/m2 and 100-1000 ppm. Based on our previous experience in designing and operating the bench top LIBS + LITE prototype and the phase I studies, we are able to design an integrated LIBS + LITE instrument with simple and robust scheme and a small size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) to meet the stringent requirement of an operational UAS. The spectroscopy subsystems utilize reflective optics to couple light from the interrogation sample ensuring co-registered views of the identical sample region. Implemented as modules, LIBS and LITE detection units share common excitation elements that enable packaging into a relatively small form factor (18 X 10 X 10 cm3) with estimated 3.7 pounds weight. In Phase II, to construct the prototype instrument, we will test the actual performance of each individual subsystem base on the finding and designs in Phase I studies, including excitation laser, collection optics, spectrometers, detectors, system integration and control software with data process algorithm. The whole system will be tailored to Army\u2019s reconnaissance missions that require ruggedness and small SWaP."

This proposed work will create an economical and efficient method for harvesting REE from domestic soil and waste sources by enabling high throughput methods of identifying microbes, in complex media, that are capable of uptaking REEs through biological mechanisms. This project\u2019s central hypothesis is that multidimensional optical sensing, including laser-induced fluorescence, can be used to quantify microbial REE content in a high-throughput fashion. This project\u2019s objectives include (1) Quantifying the optical signatures of pure and mixed REEs, as well as their signatures when mixed with enhancing additive agents, as well as those additives\u2019 impact on the integrity of the microbes\u2019 DNA; (2) Conducting yeast uptake experiments, in which yeast that preferentially uptake REEs will be used, as compared to wild type yeast, for validation and verification of the proposed sensor; (2) Designing a prototype sorting system, in which data from our preliminary experiments will be used to perform a tradespace analysis of the sorting method and detection system; and (4) Building and validating a prototype system, in which a low fluorescence microfluidics chip or colony plate will be fabricated and integrated and validated with Brimrose\u2019s sensing system. Major deliverables include (1) Reports summarizing the results of our signature analyses, tradespace analyses, and ground-truthing methods; (2) A report summarizing the experimental validation of the breadboard prototype and sources of error; and (3) Algorithms associated with the microfluidics control and classification of microbes based on the measured signals. Upon the successful completion of the program, we will proceed to design a second-generation embodiment in preparation for Phase II. \u00a0 \u00a0"

        "Abstract": "High scientific impact applications at synchrotron and free-electron laser (FEL) x-ray sources require improved x-ray optical elements. With high repetition-rate x-ray FELs and near diffraction-limited storage rings x-ray sources due to come on line in the near future, there will be even greater demand for their availability. Current x-ray optical elements based on legacy materials like silicon cannot stand up to these increasingly stringent beam line conditions. Great Lakes Crystal Technologies (GLCT), in partnership with Michigan State University (MSU), is applying their patented and proprietary advanced diamond crystal growth and fabrication technology to develop the first source of large diffraction grade diamond crystals which will overcome the performance and reliability limitations of silicon and other legacy materials in advanced x- ray diffraction applications. GLCT and MSU employed state of the art microwave chemical vapor deposition technology together with novel crystal size enlargement technology to demonstrate proof of concept for both their seed replication technology and crystal enlargement technology, paving the way for success in Phase II to create a source of large diffraction grade diamond crystals. GLCT and MSU will combine best practices to create a set of prototype large diffraction grade diamond crystals along with a roadmap for further improvements and manufacturing cost reduction. Advancements at MSU in crystal quality characterization will enable a rapidly paced materials development effort. Advanced x-ray beam lines at DOE facilities and worldwide will be able to move down their technology roadmaps and plans to continue to perform high scientific impact applications at synchrotron and free-electron laser (FEL) x-ray sources."

        "Abstract": "Effective operation of eventual laser power\/energy delivering systems to distant receivers require an adaptive optics technique capable of correcting moderate to heavy atmospheric distortion along the propagation path. The following two factors are essential for laser beam delivery to be effective:\u00a0beaconless operation of the system and a quality wavefront sensor (WFS). This proposal outlines the analysis of the innovative approach beaconless with its operation based on the Adaptive Optics Transceiver (AOT) for the most effective collection and light scattered by a distant target, and can operate with both coherent and incoherent illuminated object to form the beacon. Capturing with AOT the target-scattered light-field and processing it using WFS of appropriate speed will enable characterization of the atmosphere-perturbed wavefront and establish a virtual beacon on the target without it (laser) illumination. Phase I activities include modeling and design of AOT coupled with adequate WFS capable to characterize wavefront aberrations in simulated perturbations equivalent to Rytov &gt; 0.3. In Phase II we plan to engineer and validate a prototype-level AOT \u2013WFS system, culminating the program with its test in a realistic test environment."

        "Abstract": "To support development of Directed Energy (DE) decision aids and to characterize optical turbulence along arbitrary slant paths, Trex in collaboration with GTRI proposes to develop an eye-safe Turbulence Surveillance LIDAR (TSL). TSL is based on a synergistic coupling of a Differential Image Motion (DIM) LIDAR with a passive DIM Monitor (DIMM). The DIM LIDAR determines vertical profiles of the refractive index structure parameter Cn2 by measuring differential tilt of laser beacons created by a pulsed laser at different heights. The passive DIM Monitor measures a path-integrated value of Cn2 over the entire atmosphere by imaging natural stars, thereby increasing the range of turbulence measurements up to 10km. During Phase-II the following tasks will be performed: The proof-of-concept TSL LIDAR design will be developed; The TSL LIDAR will be assembled and LIDAR software will be developed and debugged; The sub-systems will be tested; The passive DIM Monitor will be assembled and tested; The inversion algorithm will be optimized and passive DIM Monitor software will be updated; An interface with the TSL LIDAR will be developed;; The passive DIM Monitor will be integrated with the TSL LIDAR; A fully integrated TSL system will be field-tested and demonstrated."

        "Abstract": "Ultrafast lasers play an increasingly critical role in the generation, manipulation, and acceleration of electron beams for applications ranging from basic research to medicine to industry. Plasma-based accelerators in particular stand to benefit from improved precision and stability of high power lasers, which are poised to become the drivers for a novel class of high quality electron beam sources. Significant advances in average power, precision, and stability of facility-scale laser systems are required to realize these transformative technologies. A novel class of diagnostics and associated correction schemes will be developed to enable the stabilization of laser performance at kHz repetition rates. The proposed system will combine three elements: a precise and non-perturbative laser wavefront diagnostic, a fast and flexible machine-learning-based computation of the laser focal position, and an in-hardware deployment of the corresponding optical correction. The resulting correction scheme will be integrated with standard software suites to enable the control of focal position at kHz repetition rates in conjunction with experimental operation. These tools will be designed in collaboration with a world-class high intensity laser facility. The proposed work will demonstrate the synthesis of a novel diagnostic and correction scheme for precise control of laser focal position at repetition rates greater than 10 Hz. First, a non-perturbative laser wavefront diagnostic will be tested and refined to the required tolerance. Next, a family of adaptive algorithms will be designed and trained to provide efficient correction based upon these measurements. The resulting algorithms will be deployed on a proof-of-principle field programmable gate array hardware implementation, and the deployment scheme will be validated for use in experimental facilities. Finally, an experimental demonstration will be planned for Phase II. The proposed research will drive innovation in three distinct technologies. Laser technology is ubiquitous in modern industry and research; the proposed work will improve diagnostic quality and enable high repetition rate operation for emerging high power laser applications. Field programmable gate arrays are the industry standard for delivering real-time active feedback; the proposed work will develop a deployment pipeline for integrating this technology with advanced algorithms for controls, to the benefit of a diverse array of laser and accelerator applications. Machine learning promises to greatly improve complex machine performance, maximize operational duty cycle, and reduce costs associated with operator training and supervision; the proposed work will demonstrate an efficient methodology for implementing machine learning algorithms within a broadly applicable controls framework."

        "Abstract": "Future beam-driven gigavolt-per-meter structure wakefield accelerators for a TeV scale lepton collider will require extremely high wall plug efficiency, which in turns requires extracting the maximum amount of energy from the drive beam. Bunchlet trains can suppress the dipole wakes that limit the maximum energy extraction from the drive beams. These trains are currently produced using masks, which throw away a substantial fraction of the beam. A technique to produce uniformly spaced bunchlet trains without sacrificing total charge is critical for achieving the wall plug efficiency required for a future collider. Integrated photonics structures can be used to manipulate the electric fields on the surface of a photoemitter cathode. These shaped surface fields can be used to produce tailored transverse emission profiles, which can be turned into a longitudinal profile using emittance exchange. This project will design such an integrated photonics structure suitable for producing bunchlet trains to drive a structure wakefield accelerator. In Phase I, high-fidelity simulations will be conducted of an accelerator facility suitable for a proof-of-concept experiment. Those models will then be used to backtrack an ideal distribution from the end of an emittance exchange beamline to the cathode surface. That emission pattern will then be used to design an integrated photonics structure. An experimental design will be produced for a proof-of-concept experiment to take place during Phase II. The ability to design arbitrary emission patterns from a cathode will improve future accelerator designs, enabling novel ring-shaped beams for instance, or more efficient structure wakefield accelerator driven free-electron lasers. It will also open up new experimental possibilities with transmission electron microscopy."

        "Abstract": "Next-generation light sources will rely on closely arranged sequences of high-field magnets to achieve ambitious beam parameters and high brightness. Codes available for 3D modeling and design of magnetic systems are inadequate for capturing the overlapping fields from these dense arrays of magnets. Moreover, these codes suffer from poor parallel performance, leading to long turn-around times that significantly hamper the process of design and optimization. Significant improvements to existing software are needed to address these shortcomings. The open source software Radia provides a uniquely effective tool for magnet modeling that allows for design of undulators as well as storage ring magnets. Our aim is to improve the performance of Radia through parallelization of the field calculations, interaction matrix construction, and interaction matrix relaxation. During Phase II of this project, we completed the Python interface to Radia, parallelized major parts of the computation using MPI, and developed a Sirepo interface with important functionality for working with Radia magnet models. We developed didactic documented examples of many important Radia examples using the Jupyter interface and created a software link to allow parallel operation of Radia within Jupyter as well. The Sirepo application allows export of kick-maps, field maps and tabulated undulators that are needed as a part of magnet design in a synchrotron light source. In Phase IIA, we will build off of this success to increase the utility of our Sirepo application by developing a CAD import facility allowing the import of models directly from mechanical tools such as SolidWorks. We will improve integration between Radia and other Sirepo simulation codes. We will parallelize the final component of the Radia computation, the field relaxation, using OpenMP shared memory parallelization. In addition, we will create an interface to our optimization engine rsopt within Sirepo providing convenient access to this powerful tool. Finally, we will create a rich array of parametrized magnet models within Sirepo making it easier to initiate the design of standard accelerator magnets. This project will substantially increase the speed of Radia calculations and its accessibility to a wider range of scientists and engineers throughout the light source community. The unique boundary integral method used by Radia will become more broadly available in industrial applications due to the new ability to import CAD models. Larger magnetic structures will be available for accurate field computation, decreasing risk in compact storage ring magnet designs with strong field interference effects."

        "Abstract": "Rapid ordersofmagnitude improvement in the average power of highintensity lasers with ultra short pulse lengths has become central to the continued advancement of compact, highgradient particle accelerators for electrons and positrons. There is currently a lack of broadly available modeling software to selfconsistently capture the required physics of gain, thermal loading and lensing, spectral shaping, and other effects required to quantitatively design such lasers. The first objective is to validate new computational models from Phase 1 via comparison with experimental data in a parameter regime relevant to kHz repetition rate, kWscale average power Ti:sapphire laser amplifiers. The second objective is to demonstrate correct integrated modeling of a 100 TW peak power amplifier via comparison with experimental measurements. The third objective is to develop a browserbased GUI suitable for use by the laser design community, to be built on easytouse, open source software. During Phase 1, new algorithms were developed and implemented in software to model laser wavefronts propagating through Ti:sapphire crystals, including aspects of amplification and thermal effects. A novel operator splitting approach has been developed, where both the stretched laser pulse and the crystal are sliced in a manner that enables robust algorithms, accuracy and interactive solutions. Full Fourier optics of the laser pulse is included, using a novel theoretical treatment of wavefront propagation that leverages an open source physical optics code. Thermal modeling of a cylindrical Ti:sapphire crystal has been demonstrated, using a parallel open source differential equation solver. A prototype online graphical user interface has been developed, leveraging an open source framework for scientific cloud computing. The Phase 1 algorithms and software will be generalized to include linear canonical transforms based on arbitrary optical transport matrices, and to include nonlinear effects in the index of refraction and the gain within a Ti:sapphire crystal that has been pumped with realistic asymmetries. The laser pulse model will be generalized to include finite bandwidth effects. The thermal properties of Ti:sapphire crystals will be further simulated, including mechanical stress. Experimental measurements at a stateoftheart laserplasma facility will be used to validate the software. The cloudbased graphical user interface will be completed and made available. The software developed for this project will be open source, and novel aspects of the software design will be published in the scientific literature. The cloud computing approach is uniquely powerful. New users are up and running in minutes and can share simulations instantaneously. Subscriptionbased sales and associated consulting will generate significant revenue."

        "Abstract": "Accurate and timely detection and classification of chemical and\/or biological threat agents (CBA) used by an adversary in a battlefield environment is a crucial task for reconnaissance and force protection systems. A key technology component in CBA plume sensing systems is the light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system. The LIDAR laser propagates through and backscatters off of aerosol plume droplets, producing a characteristic return related to the CBA dissemination mechanism. In the operational space of a high-intensity conflict, airborne particulates generated by vehicle movement and weapons effects create a cluttered background that reduces the effectiveness of LIDAR detection. There is a need for advanced automated tools that can separate cases of deliberate dissemination from more common kinetic events ubiquitous to the battlefield environment. Toward this objective, Spectral Sciences, Inc. (SSI) proposes to develop artificial intelligence algorithms built on an artificial intelligence (AI) framework to rapidly classify LIDAR returns as CBA or non-CBA. The proposed solution will utilize the localization of dissemination events to adopt a transfer learning approach to reduce a demand on training data. The Phase I work will prototype the basic approach and demonstrate the feasibility of achieving these goals."

        "Abstract": "The accuracy of future military electro-optical (EO) sensors for intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance (ISR), laser beam control, seeker systems and space surveillance, that operate along turbulent atmospheric lines-of-sight, can be enhanced using coherent wavefront sensing. The intervening atmospheric turbulence and vehicle wake distort the sensor observation, reducing target contrast and image resolution. A promising approach to real-time detection is single-shot digital holography (SSDH), in which a laser beam illuminates the target, and the return is processed to produce a reconstruction of the wavefront and a turbulence corrected image. The processing includes optical interference with a reference laser, retrieving the wavefront, and applying the wavefront to the return image to mitigate both atmospheric and laser speckle effects. It uses signal estimation methods to remove turbulence and speckle effects and correct the image. One of the current limitations to advancement of SSDH is the computational burden of the current physics-based Bayesian estimation approach to processing, which would require that the vehicle carry a massive on-board computer capability to produce real-time results. Spectral Sciences, Inc., in collaboration with researchers at New Mexico State University, propose to replace current computational approaches with a machine learning algorithm to speed up the processing by orders of magnitude. Our algorithm training will be informed by modeling of the sensor, vehicle wake, atmosphere, and potential targets. In Phase I, we will construct the algorithm, test it to assess its speed and performance with modeled inputs, and consider scalability. In Phase II, we will further develop the algorithm, demonstrate its performance in an optical breadboard SSDH system, and define a computational system for on-board operations."

        "Abstract": "Metal mesh filters are used to control the transmission of infrared through terahertz radiation in a variety of systems including sensors, cameras, and high-performance telescopes. Currently, high-performance metal mesh infrared filters are fabricated using photolithography but this is a costly and time consuming process and it is limited to filter diameters of 300 mm or less (the largest size that typical lithography systems can produce). In addition, there is currently no domestic manufacturer of these filters. We proposed developing a new manufacturing technique based on a proprietary nano-ablation method that can directly fabricate metal mesh filters without the need to create a photolithography mask, saving time and money, and can be scaled to areas much larger than what lithography tools can easily address. This will be done by modifying and improving a 3D microfabrication technology we have developed that utilizes advanced lasers, optics, and control software. In addition, the team will work on the simulation, design, and testing of the metal mesh filters to create a complete, domestic metal mesh filter capability. The Phase I work will experimentally demonstrate the fundamental science behind the proposed nano- ablation manufacturing technology and provide a feasibility study on scaling the nano-fabrication capability up to filter sizes greater than 600 mm. In additional, metal mesh filters will be designed and simulated using advanced simulation software to provide insight into optimal filter design, materials selection, and an analysis of variations around certain design parameters. Advanced testing will be performed on single-layer test metal mesh filters to characterize their performance. Comparisons will be made between the experimental performance and the simulated performance. If this project is carried over to Phase II, it will create a new, domestic manufacturing capability for metal mesh filters that has the potential to increase the size of the filters by four times the area of currently available filters. In addition, the underlying nano-ablation technology will be able to define micro-scale metallization directly on three-dimensional surfaces and on a variety of substrates. There are many applications for this type of capability, including, for example, very high wiring density flex circuits which can be used as superconducting cables in experimental systems such as quantum computers, millimeter wave telescopes, and other advanced applications."

Current and future human space exploration missions require an optimized air revitalization system (ARS) that can reduce the system mass, volume, and power, and increase reliability.nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; The ARS systems contains a Carbon Dioxide Reduction Assembly that is adsorbent-based and its performance is limited because COTS sorbent powder materials are used. NASA is interested in new materials and processes that will develop improved 3D-printing processes and paste formulations to increase the technology readiness level (TRL) of 3D-printing or robocasting processes for producing net-shape, monolithic sorbent beds as drop-in replacements for packed sorbent beds such as those in the CDRA. The HiFunda\/PADT team is proposing to design hierarchical (meso, macro, micro porosity) zeolite-based, monolithic adsorbent beds for CO2 removal that will be 3D-printed using an aluminosilicate (geopolymer) to bind commercially-available zeolite particles together (3DZeoGeo zeolite paste material and 3D-printing process). The aluminosilicate binder will be cured in situ via chemical reaction that is accelerated by the laser thermal treatment.nbsp; The 3D-printed monolithic zeolite adsorbent bed will be a drop-in replacement for the existing powder bed with improved mass transfer, heat transfer, mechanical robustness properties.nbsp; nbsp;nbsp;In Phase I, the HiFunda\/PADT team will develop and demonstrate robustness and performance of its 3DZeoGeo zeolite paste material and 3D-printing process in a proof-of-concept monolithic adsorbent test vehicle (POC-ATV) that will be tested and characterized for CO2 removal performance, pressure drop, and mechanical strength. The proposed technology will be further refined and demonstrated on an ATV design of interest to NASA and\/or aerospace contractors in Phase II."

        "Abstract": "We propose to develop transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) components that will enable up to 40 Gb\/s communication over a free-space communication link (FSCL) operating in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR). Such components when commercialized will enable lower latency than satellite links, greater security than radio-frequency (RF), longer range than mm-wave, and greater availability in haze and turbulence relative to near-IR systems. To maximize the spectral efficiency, and therefore the data throughput, of a limited-bandwidth free-space link, we propose to develop linear E\/O and O\/E transducers at MWIR (and eventually LWIR) wavelengths. These linear E\/O and O\/E modules will enable software-defined-radio methods to maximize the data throughput based on the available optical channel. The buried-heterostructure (BH) distributed feedback (DFB) quantum cascade laser (QCL) designed in the Phase 1 program is expected to deliver a stable, single- mode output (&lt; 100 microrad beam-pointing stability) with average powers greater than 1 W under high-speed modulation. The design has low capacitance and photon lifetime, enabling &gt; 5 GHz 3-dB bandwidth with usable bandwidth exceeding 15 GHz. Further optimization of the lasers, such as our proprietary high-power QCL concept that would achieve &gt; 1 W stable, single- mode average power for shorter cavity lengths, is expected to double these bandwidth values. The detector design we have developed is based on the original resonant-cavity infrared-detector (RCID) structure but with major improvements: rapid wavelength tunability, carrier collection time of ~ 2 ps, and drastically reduced device capacitance. Even with a 5-GHz modulation bandwidth, we can achieve &gt; 20 Gb\/s using 16 QAM modulation based on our expected link dynamic range. If atmospheric conditions reduce the available dynamic range, the proposed link architecture can switch to robust QPSK or BPSK modulation instantaneously. The transducers may also include multiple elements to enable multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) or single-input multiple output (SIMO) methods. For example, on the receive side, light received by multiple apertures is independently detected and then combined judiciously to maximize the resulting signal to noise ratio (SNR) in the presence of turbulence and beam wander. \u00a0The proposed program will conclude with a link demonstration showing the capacity and robustness of the approach."

The triad of Kinetic, High-Power Microwave and Laser weapon systems currently used or considered for Counter-UAV (C-UAV) operation though effective in disrupting their performance, might be hazardous when used in a populated area. In the Phase I program AS&amp;T proposed an alternative technology with its C-UAV denial enactment based on the use of the laser-induced broadband RF radiation. In Phase I, AS&amp;T performed the feasibility study of its proposed C-UAV concept and established the LAPLAS concept of operation and specification. The feasibility study included modeling, simulation and laboratory validation of the LAPLAS breadboard. Practical implementation and experimental evaluation of a fully assembled system will be performed in Phase II. The Phase II activities comprise of design, integration and testing of the LAPLAS prototype. The program will culminate with lab testing of the LAPLAS prototype, and conclude with field-validation and demonstration of its performance in a scenario relevant to potential\/prospective operational environment."

        "Abstract": "Today\u2019s soldiers and vehicles are equipped with sensors and devices that are \u2018connected\u2019 through boards, processors\/chips, transceivers, and micro mechanical systems.\u00a0 To design, fabricate and embed sensors and devices on the warfighter and to connect them efficiently is going to require multiple advanced manufacturing technologies: Subtractive Manufacturing (CNC), Additive Manufacturing (AM) and Laser.\u00a0 With three major manufacturing tools on a single platform, the user can manufacture a variety of products - from simple 3D metal components to macro-circuits with embedded components to RF antennas to laser machined parts to wearable printed sensors.\u00a0 This is a powerful tool for the next generation of engineers and technicians to re-think ways to design, create, and manufacture things that are vital to national manufacturing infrastructures.\u00a0 The combination of subtractive and additive tools allows components to be integrated into existing parts and, in some cases, allows complete manufacture of a part with sensors embedded during the manufacturing process. We anticipate extensive application in both the DoD and private sector by providing a computer-integrated manufacturing ecosystem that enables the user to explore design ideas, fabricate prototypes, and iterate as needed to maximize design potential using a 3D true 5-axis system; for some uses, the final product, not just prototype, will be manufactured with this tool. In the Phase II sequential we will build on the results of Phase II to continue development of an Intuitive Manufacturing Ecosystem (IME) designed around user efficiency.\u00a0 The ecosystem is the integration of industry standard manufacturing tools and user support features providing the benefits of maintainability, usability, scalability, and multi-platform capability on a single platform. Apart from the tool development aspects, we will develop a new microscale 3D metal AM fabrication process using metal paste (not powder) and laser melting. In line with embedding process development, the direct fabrication of micro-sized metal parts has the potential to open new horizons toward miniaturization of sensors and devices. \u00a0As a separate task, we will explore directly printing shaped charge explosives from exotic materials, which can greatly help the development a system that can sense and rapidly activate externally mounted thrusters to limit the damage to a military vehicle and save lives. Direct fabrication of energetic structural materials and reactive metals using exotic metals can speed up the development of active protection systems for military vehicles from under-body blast."

        "Abstract": "The ever-growing need for high-data rate, low-latency, secure, wireless communications driven by applications ranging from vehicle automation to ad-hoc battlefield command and control necessitate free space communication links (FSCLs) operating outside of the regulated and crowded RF-frequency bands. We propose to develop transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) components that will enable up to 40 Gb\/s communication over a free-space communication link (FSCL) operating in the long-wave infrared (LWIR). To maximize the spectral efficiency, and therefore the data throughput, of a limited-bandwidth free-space link, we propose to develop linear, LWIR, electrical-to-optical and optical-to-electrical transducers. These linear modules will enable software-defined-radio methods to maximize the data throughput based on the available optical channel. Recent research has verified that there are advantages to using LWIR wavelengths for FSCLs through the atmosphere. When the channel transmission is affected by fog, clouds, dust, or wind, a near-IR (~ 1.55 mm wavelength) FSCL suffers relative to systems operating at longer wavelengths. LWIR systems near 10 to 11 mm benefit from a wavelength larger than many fog or cloud droplets, reducing scattering, as well as the coincidence of relatively low atmospheric absorption at those wavelengths. LWIR systems also benefit from a reduced impact of turbulence-driven scintillation and beam broadening. Intraband, working with the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison) and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), proposes to investigate the feasibility of FSCLs based on the UW\/Intraband 1-W MOCVD-grown QCL technology and the NRL resonant-cavity infrared detectors (RCIDs), optimized for modulation bandwidth &gt; 5 GHz, transmitter power &gt; 1 W, narrow linewidth, and link signal to noise ratio. The RCID resonant cavity reduces the absorber thickness required to achieve high quantum efficiency in the detector. This reduced thickness reduces the dark current, increases specific detectivity, and decreases carrier transit time. The narrow LWIR optical bandwidth of the RCID also aids in rejecting background radiation but does require a QCL with narrow linewidth. Intraband will work with the UW-Madison to design and model high-power, narrow-linewidth QCLs optimized for high-speed modulation in the LWIR. NRL will investigate the feasibility of &gt; 5-GHz bandwidth for a LWIR RCID and provide modeled characteristics for devices and for arrays. Intraband will establish the feasibility of &gt; 5GHz LWIR QCL linear transmission through simulations and experiments."

        "Abstract": "The technology that has sustained tactical missile radomes and other electromagnetic windows is being outpaced by the increasingly challenging thermal, environmental and structural demands of hypersonic flights. New engineered materials, that exceed state-of-the-art capabilities are required to support the next generation of hypersonic vehicles. Silicon nitride is the next-generation material candidate. However, silicon nitride is a ceramic material. As such, it is a strong yet brittle material that can fail catastrophically.\u00a0 The prevention of catastrophic failure necessarily relies on Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) technology, an engineered material consisting of fiber reinforcements embedded within a ceramic matrix, in this instance, silicon nitride fibers. This proposal addresses a void in the market: There are no commercially available silicon nitride fibers, and for good reasons. How does one make fibers with a material that does not melt, does not soften, and does not tolerate the presence of impurities at high temperatures? Free Form Fibers does it with lasers. Our proprietary fiber laser printing technology has been used to produce like materials, such a silicon carbide. Under the proposed project, Free Form Fibers will seek to adapt its fiber laser printing technology to the fabrication of fabrication of silicon nitride fibers. Once this goal is reached, Free Form Fibers will move toward establishing a domestic fiber production capacity. In parallel, Free Form Fibers will seek to establish a prototype production demonstration for silicon nitride CMC components."

        "Abstract": "The design of the High Energy Laser (HEL) operator Human-Machine Interface (HMI) faces a number of challenges. The HEL operator will be asked to deal with large quantities of information and fast-paced task demands over a wide variety of tasking. These multiple and high-frequency task demands could lead to fatigue and lethal errors. Pacific Science &amp; Engineering is highly experienced in developing evidence-based, effective HMIs for information-rich, fast paced, and high stakes environments. The objective of this Phase I effort is to develop innovative and effective HMI concepts and provide analyses to demonstrate the viability of these concepts so that they can be fully realized as high-fidelity prototypes in Phase II. During Phase I, PSE will use its proprietary user-centered design methodology to develop an evidence-based concept for the HEL operator HMI and then assess its feasibility. The benefits of these new, evidence-based operator HMI concepts are that they fit the operators\u2019 tasking, workflow, and cognitive capabilities, thereby reducing operator fatigue, response delay, and error while improving operator situation awareness and decision making. The application goal is full implementation of these HMI concepts within the HEL system by applying the HEL HMI style guide to be developed by this project."

        "Abstract": "Hypersonic air vehicles are being developed for a variety of military applications because of their global reach and rapid response ability. EO\/IR sensors on these platforms need to provide high-quality imagery to support these missions. Similarly, laser directed energy (DE) systems need to stabilize the beam and compensate for wavefront aberrations at high frame rates. When looking through optical windows in hypersonic flight, these sensors will be looking through shocks, inviscid flow features, turbulent boundary layers, aero-heated windows, and window deformations due to aerodynamic loading. When imaging targets at long distance, atmosphere turbulence, scattering, and refractive propagation will further degrade sensor imaging. Digital holography (DH) is a rapidly emerging technology that can meet requirements for wavefront sensing on hypersonic platforms in a practical way. At the same time, machine learning techniques have merged for wavefront sensing in many applications. MZA Associates Corporation proposes to design an appropriate DH system for wavefront sensing, augment its processing with machine learning, and devise a computational processing pipeline that meets the required system bandwidth."

        "Abstract": "Vescent Photonics, LLC proposes to develop a compact, environmentally robust, ultrafast erbium fiber oscillator with ultra-low timing jitter for use in optical signal processing applications. The proposed mode-locked laser will provide a low noise source with wide optical bandwidth for field deployment on mobile platforms, meeting all performance requirements outlined in the solicitation in a modular package with low size, weight, and power (SWaP). This effort will leverage over eight years of experience that Vescent has accumulated in developing mode-locked Er:fiber oscillators and micro-optic-based laser systems for field deployed applications in quantum sensing, atomic clocks, and applied spectroscopy. Building upon our existing commercially available mode-locked oscillator, our optical-fiber-based architecture uses polarization-maintaining fiber and a semiconductor saturable absorber mirror (SESAM) to ensure extremely reliable mode-locking operation in a compact module. Careful design of the laser cavity results in a measured timing jitter of less than 10 fs and an optical bandwidth of 25 nm. Under the proposed work, improvements to this design will shrink the fiber optic packaging and integrate low-SWaP pump lasers and driver electronics to obtain a total package volume of less than 100 cm3 and with a total electrical power draw of less than 3 W. At the completion of Phase II, a turnkey laser module will be delivered to the Navy that will be an ideal pulsed source for optical signal processing in field deployed military applications."

        "Abstract": "Light absorption by aerosols is a key component to atmospheric extinction, and affects a number of processes relevant to the Navy. Satellite and other remotely sensed measurements can be strongly impacted by aerosols, obscuring targets and\/or confounding interpretation of data products. Directed energy applications, including weapon and communication systems, are also impacted by absorption, which affects processes such as thermal blooming. There is currently a lack of reliable, sensitive aerosol absorption instrumentation capable of operating in challenging field environments and at wavelengths needed for measurements relevant to the Navy, including in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. To address this need, we propose commercial development of a proven system based on photoacoustic technology, originally developed at NOAA and further enhanced by researchers at the University of Wyoming. The system is readily adaptable to the wavelengths of interest and has a proven track record for providing highly accurate, sensitive measurements of light absorption in the visible, including measurements from airborne platforms. Phase I of our effort focuses on de-risking the development by first evaluating the performance characteristics of several candidate optical systems (lasers, mirrors) that will be implemented in the existing Wyoming instrument hardware. We will also test a novel calibration approach that will greatly simplify operation of the instrument in the field by non-specialists, a critical step towards operational use and broader commercial applications. Finally, in the option period we begin transitional work towards a new instrument prototype that focuses on improving the ability of the instrument to measure particles over a broad size range and simplify temperature control."

        "Abstract": "The Phase I research objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of optimizing gas flow for producing defect-free repair of structural metal components using Directed Energy Deposition (DED) Additive Manufacturing (AM). Insight into the multi-physics gas interaction with metal fusion and the causality of gas-induced defect formation in DED repair will be developed using an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) modeling framework. The gas flow model and the formation of nozzle debris due to spatter and ricochet particles will be calibrated and validated using gas velocity measurements and the in-situ layer-by-layer sensing of powder flow and top surface topology during deposition experiments. The nozzle debris mass and the geometry of melt pool formation will be used as objective functions in the ICME modeling to fine-tune the gas flow and DED processing parameters, respectively. Defect mitigation will be validated using metallography. Phase I Option will extend the ICME modeling framework, in-situ sensing, and validation experiments to Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF). Phase II will demonstrate a prototype of an ICME modeling framework for DED and LPBF to fine-tune gas flow, mitigate build defects, reduce surface roughness, and enhance mechanical properties. The build material will be alloy Ti-6Al-4V."

        "Abstract": "Most existing simulation tools are deficient in modeling gas flow effects, which have been proven to significantly affect the build quality of metal additive manufacturing (AM). In Phase I, the research team will extend our current Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) modeling toolkit by including a multiscale and multiphysics simulation modules to predict the effect of gas flow on metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes for improving the quality of the parts. The framework carefully integrates the discrete element method, chamber-scale aerodynamics, and powder-scale thermal multiphase flow models to comprehensively resolve the multi-physics in the metal AM process and quantify the gas flow effects on melt pool dimensions, surface roughness, solidification rate, powder spattering, and pore formation\/propagation. The developed framework will be thoroughly first validated on laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) using existing data and new experiments conducted by the team. Then, the model will be extended to model multi-layer multi-track LPBF and directed energy deposition (DED) processes. Physics-informed machine learning-based surrogate models will also be constructed to enable the performance driven process design. The developed framework will directly quantify the gas flow effects by taking AM parameters and material properties as inputs and help establish practical mitigation strategies for the gas-induced powder spattering and pore formation."

        "Abstract": "Hydrometeors consisting of liquid water droplets or solid particles of ice can disrupt the boundary layer near hypersonic vehicles, and ultimately impinge on the surface causing surface roughness and further altering the flowfield. To advance the knowledge of hydrometeors and their impact on hypersonic flight, it is critical, therefore, to develop practical, high-fidelity and spatio-temporally resolved three-dimensional measurements of their behavior under relevant conditions. The proposed research effort will (i) demonstrate and characterize three-dimensional imaging of hydrometeor aerobreakup in test facilities of interest to the ONR, especially for the most complex flowfields, (ii) optimize kHz\u2013MHz imaging schemes to cover a wide range of spatio-temporal scales and reduce ambiguities along the line of sight, (iii) simultaneously image the gas-phase using techniques such as laser-induced fluorescence, background oriented schlieren, and digital in-line holography to capture three-dimensional state variables such as density, temperature, and species, (iv) employ complementary diagnostics such as molecular tagging for velocimetry, and (v) explore a robust, portable diagnostics suite and integrated software for post-processing and analysis. This will lead to data on quantitative imaging of hydrometeor aerobreakup for model validation and a prototype commercial instrument for use in hypersonic test facilities."

        "Abstract": "Ecological and biogeochemical processes occurring along coastal interfaces are poorly understood on a mechanistic level and critically underrepresented in current models, impeding our ability to make informed resource management decisions. Stable isotope ratio measurements, e.g., 13C\/12C, can provide detail about pathways and sources by adding specificity and attribution information that concentration measurements alone are unable to capture. Currently, isotope measurements are obtained by collecting a relatively small number of samples and analyzing those off-site using a laboratory device. The proposed field sensor will open up the ability to significantly increase the temporal and spatial resolution of the measurements enabling a far more detailed study of shifting conditions, along with the ability to capture transients. We propose the development of a novel field sensor for in-situ monitoring of stable isotope ratios in terrestrial-aquatic interface (TAI) regions. The sensor utilizes mid-infrared (Mid-IR) laser absorption spectroscopy to uniquely identify and quantify molecular species (e.g., CH4, CO2, and their isotopologues). The concept uses a novel hollow fiber gas cell, which enables high sensitivity in a compact form factor appropriate for remote field use. The proposed work leverages recent development of both CO2 isotope sensors for laboratory rhizosphere analysis along with related CH4 isotope sensors for in-situ deep-sea vent\/seep analysis. For this effort, we are proposing to apply, optimize, and specifically engineer these new developments to address needs at coastal TAI field sites. This will include further reductions in size, weight, and power (SWaP), along with networking and integration of complimentary sensors for \u201csmart\u201d utilization. The effort will be done in collaboration with DOE field scientists, who will both guide the development and test the resulting sensor systems. In Phase I, a methane isotope system will be assembled utilizing a new sampling front end that will be specifically optimized for TAI applications. A brassboard sensor package will be produced to prove the basic concept. The brassboard will be tested by DOE scientists to baseline the performance and explore aspects in need of further development. Results and user feedback from the testing will be utilized to design a higher Technology Readiness Level (TRL) system to be produced in Phase II. The resulting sensors will also be utilized for a range of commercial applications related to natural gas (e.g., methane) leak and attribution analysis."

        "Abstract": "NSL recognizes the need within high energy science and inertial fusion to develop ultrafast diagnostics to assess plasma conditions for High Energy Density science and Inertial Fusion experiments. The current limitation of existing measurement tools is in the constraints of streak cameras. Therefore, there is interest in developing ultrafast pixel cameras by reading high speed photodetectors and sensor arrays with compact electronics. Such an approach would facilitate transformative diagnostics at many DOE labs. This new measurement approach is made possible by integrating advances in 1) High-speed multi-channel waveform digitizing chips, 2) ultra-fast photodiode x-ray and particle detector arrays, and 3) advanced packaging and interconnect technologies. The proposed approach allows arrays from 10k of pixels of time-resolving detectors to be easily and cost-effectively integrated into HED experiments, something presently out of reach of the majority of scientists at mid-scale HED facilities and for individual-investigator research projects. The sensor array will be assembled on a separate and removable electronics board to enable customization for specific measurements optimized for x-rays, neutrons, visible light, electrons, or ions. Given recent advances in detectors and electronics, there is a chance to make a 10-20x improvement in performance while lowering the cost. The main goal of this Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of the WURP and de-risk a Phase II project to actually develop a working prototype. In order to achieve this, the main objectives consist in: Understand signal levels and performance of the proposed APDs Understand and design for interfacing requirements between APDs and existing Nalu readout chips.Design and develop a preliminary prototype system, package it and perform laser or other testing. Compare test results with simulations and other calculations for timing and spatial resolution. NSL proposes to design and commercialize the Wideband Ultrafast Recorder for high energy density Plasmas. The WURP as a commercially available camera with common knowledge base, hardware, firmware, and software can be deployed in a variety of experiments and applications from massive projects such as those at the National Ignition Facility, subcritical experiments at the Nevada National Security Site, or Laser Energetics experiments."

        "Abstract": "Terahertz (THz) imaging systems are important for many applications, including non-destructive evaluation, cancer screening, and security. The best performing THz imaging systems utilize femtosecond lasers and ultrafast photoconductive antenna (PCA) switches for optoelectronic generation and read-out of THz pulses.\u00a0 To operate at high speeds, PCAs are based on sub-picosecond carrier lifetime materials such as low temperature grown gallium arsenide (LT-GaAs). A typical THz PCA sensor element is nearly a centimeter in size and large compared to sub-mm THz wavelengths.\u00a0 This makes it impractical to implement an imaging focal plane array (FPA) in PCA technology. Instead, imaging in the THz range is accomplished with a single PCA element by mechanically raster scanning over a field of view. This proposal applies novel device design and processing techniques to solve the pixel size issue in PCA arrays. The proposed technology has potential to deliver 1-3 THz bandwidth, dynamic range &gt; 30 dB, and 1 Hz frame rates in an ultra- compact and high-resolution imaging FPA more than 1 kilo pixels in size."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nFocused ultrasound (FUS) is an early-stage, noninvasive technology with great therapeutic potential in\noncology and other diseases. FUS offers either an alternative or complementary strategy to existing cancer\ntreatment approaches such as surgery, radiation, drug delivery, and immunotherapy (immuno-oncology, or\n\u201cIO\u201d). Most recently, IO specifically has demonstrated enormous potential to have a \u201cgame-changing\u201d impact in\nour fight against cancer, however the fraction of responders to IO monotherapy remains low (lt25%). It is\nbecoming increasingly clear that adjuvant treatments that modulate the tumor microenvironment, such as FUS,\nwhich has shown to be an immunomodulator, will be critical to continue the progress made by IO.\nUnfortunately, despite empirically observed improvements in treatment outcomes, the mechanisms of action of\nFUS are largely unknown and data remain unclear how to best make use of this highly impactful technology.\nTherefore, preclinical research with robust mechanistic hypothesis testing is desperately needed. However,\ntools to enable preclinical research are greatly lacking in standardization, ease-of-use, accessibility, and\nthroughput. Our customer discovery process has identified the lack of availability of image-guided FUS delivery\nhardware for small animals as a critical pain point in the field. To address this need, SonoVol Inc. will build\nupon Phase I success by developing a turnkey image-guided therapy platform (\u201cTherUS\u201d) to remove the\nchallenges associated with studying FUS treatment strategies. TherUS will offer two core functions: treatment\nmodalities to deliver immune-modulation energy to tissue, and imaging modalities to guide and monitor those\ntreatments in 3D. Unlike other solutions, the new TherUS will ensure accurate and repeatable dose delivery\nirrespective of user expertise in a cost-effective and high-throughput manner leveraging SonoVol\u2019s robotic,\nhands-free technology. TherUS will accelerate clinical translation of novel cancer therapies by lowering the\ntechnological barriers which limit widespread access, putting the technology directly in the hands of the\nbroader market of cancer biologists and immunologists to develop cutting-edge anticancer treatment\nstrategies. The proposed work will proceed via three stages. First, we will improve the robotic gantry that\ncontrols ultrasound transducer positioning to facilitate multi-modal guidance, treatment, and real-time\nmonitoring (e.g. thermometry). Second, we will develop software to facilitate treatment planning and\nconfirmation of dose delivery, including registration algorithms for alignment to previous treatment timepoints.\nLastly, we will conduct several in vivo studies designed to verify and validate the integrated device. TherUS\ntechnology represents an innovative combination of a widefield 3D robotic ultrasound, photoacoustic, and\nbioluminescence imaging system and bi-modal therapies (focused ultrasound and laser) with real-time dose\ndelivery feedback. Furthermore, the technology can be applied in the future to many other applications,\nincluding wound healing, neuro, and gene therapy, increasing the potential market and scientific impacts."

        "Abstract": "Project Summary\/Abstract:\nThe objective of this proposal is to create a new low-cost transendoscopic laser\/basket aiming tool that makes\nureteroscopic kidney stone removal easier for physicians, so that fewer patients require invasive surgery.\nClinical signi\ufb01cance comes from the 230,000 patients per year (in the USA alone) with larger stone sizes,\nfor whom surgeons currently face a dilemma. They must either choose invasive surgery, or perform a lengthy\nureteroscopy which increases complication rates, and consumes excessive operating room time. Our central\nhypothesis is that by increasing laser and basket dexterity, our new device will reduce the procedure time by\nmore than 25% for patients with larger stones. Achieving this would make many more patients candidates for\nureteroscopy; it will make it possible to remove larger stones almost as quickly as smaller stones are removed\ntoday.\nInnovation comes from harnessing elastic interactions in asymmetrically stiff, thin-walled tubes to create a\nsteerable aiming tip that is (1) small enough to pass through a standard ureterosocope port, while (2) carrying\na laser \ufb01ber or kidney stone basket within its open central lumen. The stiffness asymmetry of the tubes (which\nare attached at their tips) transforms small axial motions applied at the endoscope handle into dexterous local\nbending at the endoscope tip. The result is an inexpensive, disposable, luminal device for dexterously steering\nlaser \ufb01bers and kidney stone baskets, which is compatible with existing endoscopes, laser \ufb01bers, and baskets.\nOur approach in Aim 1 is to build an OR-ready version of our device by using catheter-inspired tip design\nprocesses with a surgeon interface amenable to practical, scalable manufacturing.

        "Abstract": "Project Summary\/Abstract:\nThe objective of this proposal is to create a new low-cost, needle-sized steerable endoscope that makes it\npossible to survey and diagnose middle ear disease using a minimally-invasive trans-Eustachian tube approach,\nsparing patients from invasive surgery.\nClinical signi\ufb01cance comes from the 84,000 surgeries per year (in the USA alone) performed on patients who\nsuffer from a middle ear disease called cholesteatoma that requires exploratory surgery for diagnosis, which is\ncurrently achieved surgically by lifting the eardrum to expose the middle ear space. Surgery is currently the only\nde\ufb01nitive way to diagnose these patients. Worse yet, a second surgery is performed to check for recurrence\na year later \u2013 even though 67% of patients will be disease free at that time. We seek to replace surgical\ninspection with a simple endoscopy, facilitated by our new ultra-thin steerable endoscope passed through the\nEustachian tube. Our central hypothesis is that our new trans-tubal endoscopic approach can achieve diagnostic\nvisualization of the middle ear equivalent to that provided by surgery today. This has the potential to spare many\npatients from the pain and complications associated with surgery, by replacing it with a simple endoscopy done\nthrough the nose.\nInnovation comes from harnessing elastic interactions in asymmetrically stiff, thin-walled tubes to create a\nsteerable endoscope that is (1) small enough to pass through the Eustachian tube, while (2) carrying a tiny\ncamera and optical illumination \ufb01bers within its own central lumen. The small diameter of the Eustachian tube\nprecludes the use of bulky standard endoscope steering mechanisms. Instead, we harness stiffness asymmetry\nencoded into the material properties of two tubes that are attached at their tips, thereby transforming small axial\nmotions applied at the endoscope handle into dexterous local bending at the endoscope tip. The result is an\ninexpensive, needle-sized, disposable, steerable endoscope for trans-tubal visualization of the middle ear.\nOur approach in Aim 1 is to use laser micromanufacturing and catheter-inspired design processes to fabricate\na clinic-ready steerable endoscope tip with integrated imaging and illumination. Aim 2 incorporates rigorous\nquality and human factors-based design enhancements, preparing our device for FDA 510(k) clearance review\nimmediately at the end of Phase II. Aim 3 focuses on statistically powered experiments to evaluate our hypothesis\nthat our new steerable aiming tip will enable middle ear inspection and cholesteatoma diagnoses to be performed\nusing a non-surgical, trans-Eustachian tube approach, with equal diagnostic-quality visual coverage compared\nto the surgical standard-of-care. Success in validating these hypotheses will strongly motivate future Phase III\nactivities (supported by private capital after the conclusion of this Phase II SBIR) where we complete the FDA\n510(k) clearance process, and launch our device on the market."

        "Abstract": "AbstractTo establish the efficacy of interstitial photodynamic therapy (I-PDT) for solid cancer treatments, the\ntreating physician needs to be able to tailor the treatments to each patient. During I-PDT in the clinic, there is a\nneed to adjust the irradiance (light dose rate) and fluence (light dose) to account for patient-specific tissue and\ntumor optical properties and to account for changes in fiber placements that occur after an initial pretreatment\nplan is generated. This can be accomplished with the novel, near real-time computational software, DOSIETM,\ndeveloped by Simphotek, Inc. The DOSIE key advantages are: (i) it is a dedicated single-package software\npackage for computing dose metrics of intratumoral light irradiance and fluence for I-PDT; and (ii) it includes a\nfast algorithm for updating the laser light settings according to optical properties of the tumor and actual fiber\nplacement in near real-time. To demonstrate that DOSIE can effectively guide I-PDT, Simphotek and RP propose\nto conduct a pilot Phase II clinical study (Phase IIa) on patients with solid malignancies in the lung causing central\nairway obstruction involving extrinsic tumor growth and related airway compression. The proposed trial will utilize\nendobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with a transbronchial needle (TBN) that will be used to guide optical diffuser\nfiber insertion for intratumoral illumination in I-PDT. The DOSIE treatment planning system that will be employed\nin this trial is vital to calculate the intratumoral fluence and irradiance, which will impact tumor response in I-PDT\nof the locally advanced cancers."

        "Abstract": "Minimally-invasive optical imaging is being advanced by molecular probes that enhance contrast using\nfluorescence. The applications in cancer imaging are very broad, ranging from early diagnosis of cancer to the\nguiding of interventions, such as biopsy. The high-sensitivity afforded by wide-field fluorescence imaging using\nscanning laser light is being developed for these broad applications. The platform technology is the SFE \u2013\nScanning Fiber Endoscope, which places a sub-1-mm scanner at the tip of a highly flexible shaft. Because\nseveral different laser wavelengths can be mixed and scanned together, full-color reflectance imaging will be\ncombined with near infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging in a 4-channel multimodal SFE. The goal of this\nproject is to develop a prototype VerAvanti 4-channel multimodal SFE (mmSFE) for a specific cancer imaging\napplication that can have significant impact in early detection and endoscopic treatment of esophageal cancer.\nVerAvanti is a start-up company located in Redmond, Washington and is founded and staffed with engineering\ngraduates from the University of Washington (UW), where the SFE was invented and tested in pilot clinical\ntrials. VerAvanti has exclusive license to commercialize the SFE technology for medical imaging and a 3-\nchannel full color SFE (using red, green, and blue reflectance) is already in pilot manufacturing and testing.\nThis project will rapidly translate the 4-channel mmSFE technology into a specific product for fluorescently\nguiding endoscopic interventions in the GI tract. Furthermore, the VerAvanti mmSFE will be designed for\nefficient manufacturing in a modular format with reduced part numbers and expected lower cost.\nThe application is using NIR fluorescence molecular probes that were developed at the University of Michigan\n(UM) that bind to high grade dysplasia (HGD) and neoplastic cells of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The\nmmSFE product is introduced through the working channel of a conventional endoscope to identify regions of\nthe lower esophagus that are over-expressing EGFR and ErbB2, which are transmembrane tyrosine kinase\nreceptors that stimulate epithelial cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Overexpression of these targets\nreflects an increase in biological aggressiveness and higher risk for progression to Barrett&apos;s esophagus, HGD,\nand EAC. The design of the mmSFE diagnostic algorithm is based on the high correlation of the fluorescence\nlesion target-to-background measurement in collaboration with UW and UM. Additional mmSFE guided tools\nwill be developed for more accurate endoscopic interventions using NIR fluorescence molecular probes. Both\nsoftware and hardware will be fabricated and tested for the start of a multisite clinical trial using the mmSFE."

        "Abstract": "Military DEWs place stringent requirements on fiber laser that cannot rely on existing commercial solutions. DoD organizations invest heavily into fiber laser development, ranging from using existing CoTS fibers to R&amp;D of new optical fibers. Fabricated fibers do not match the design, even for CoTS fibers that can vary even in a single draw. Currently, simulation tools to analyze measured fiber data and predict the behavior of the fiber in a high-power amplifier only exist within a handful of research laboratories; even the fiber manufactures themselves do not have this capability. Most laboratories and companies must invest significant time and money to physically construct and measure a fiber\u2019s performance. The DEW community requires a commercial service that provides a complete assessment on physically measured fiber profiles. To this end, we propose to develop a complete simulation environment for assessing the performance of given measured fiber profiles in a high-power amplifier configuration. The predictive suite includes modeling based on the measured RIP and DIP, using the most advanced fiber amplifier models in existence. The new software will be completely operational at the end of the Phase II program, without requiring Phase III investment to commercialize for DoD use.

        "Abstract": "We propose the development of a novel laser-based gyro and accelerometer, pushing the sensitivity to the fundamental limit. The device is based on two correlated frequency combs of the same repetition rate, generated in a single laser cavity. Because of this correlation, while the bandwidth of a tooth of each comb is in the Megahertz range, the bandwidth of the interference is less than 1 Hertz. Dispersion control of the circulating laser pulses leads to a further increase in sensitivity of this intracavity phase interferometer.In addition to the boost in sensitivity, we will reduce the noise. The classical noise limit will be reached by classical means like a high repetition rate of the measurement and additional control loops. Applying the technique of squeezed light will then be used to approach the fundamental limit of sensitivity.The results of a Phase I study on a discrete-components OPO will be applied to two fiber-OPO prototypes in Phase II. These devices are expected to be competitive with the LIGO in terms of sensitivity."

        "Abstract": "The goal of this project is to develop a tool (hard- and software) to reliably and non- destructively predict the laser-induced damage threshold of optical elements. This tool will mainly be applied to optical elements for high-power lasers as they are operated by the Department of Energy but are also increasingly used in manufacturing, defense, and medicine (e.g. as proton- or ion-sources for cancer therapy). The proposed project will combine a number of non-destructive optical measurements that are known to potentially identify defects that seed laser-induced damage. These measurements will then be correlated to extract a merit function for the damage resistance of the optical element under test, depending on the parameters of the incident laser pulse like pulse duration, wavelength, and repetition rate. In Phase I, we will scan optical elements with different optical probes and test the validity of the utilized methods for the prediction of optical damage by comparing the prediction to actual damage tests. At the end of Phase I we envision a test protocol and an optical-bench setup to put this protocol into practice. In Phase II, we will work towards the commercialization of this approach, realizing or exceeding the specifications requested in the solicitation, and establishing a test site that can offer this measurement and characterization procedure as a service to customers."

(PSI) will design for manufacture by HyperLight Corporation in Harvard University&apos;s fabrication facility is made possible by two developments: 1. PSI&apos;s realization that various previously demonstrated parallel arrangements (or &quot;arrays&quot;) of modulators differ only in how the light from lasers at one or more wavelengths is interferometrically combined after being phase modulated by the RF signal or signals on one or more sets of coplanar traveling-wave electrodes, and 2. Harvard University&apos;s and HyperLight Corporation&apos;s joing development of high-performance modulators in thin (tens of microns rather than millimeters of thickness) lithium niobate deposited on silicon wafers.\u00a0 In the 15-month &quot;Base&quot; portion of Phase II, PSI proposes to build and demonstrate a 1 - 18 GHz laboratory prototype of the FCMA.\u00a0 By &quot;laboratory prototype&quot; we mean that the FCMA will be aligned to optical fibers that provide optical input(s) and output(s), but that these fiber pigtails will not be attached.\u00a0 In the proposed 12-month &quot;Option&quot;, PSI will arrange to Alter Technology and Kyocera America, Inc. assist us in permanent attachment of the fiber pigtails to the FCMA in a compact and easily transported package."

        "Abstract": "Characterization of the X-ray FEL and synchrotron beam profiles are achieved by using the X-ray profile screens that consist of a scintillator and a CCD camera. Currently, YAG:Ce single crystal is the primary scintillator used for this application. However, YAG:Ce can not dissipate the absorbed energy associated with the high repetition rate and high flux upgrades of the beamlines and is physically damaged. Under this SBIR program, we will develop a high-thermal-conductivity scintillator for high-resolution X-ray detector screens for high power density X-ray sources. The major tasks of phase I would be: (a) Demonstration of a high spatial-resolution high thermal-conductivity X-ray detector, and (b) Optimization of the detector for heat dissipation and scintillation properties. This high thermal conductivity rugged scintillator that will be developed under this program will have multifaceted commercial applications in harsh environments. In addition to physics experiments, these scintillators have immense potential in industrial and homeland security applications a such as X-ray inspection stations."

However, High Energy Laser (HEL) lethality is limited by turbulence-induced beam broadening. Since slant-range calculation of turbulence effects relies on vertical C_n^2 profiles, Aret\u00e9 will develop a novel platform to quantify these vertical turbulence profiles using a drone-mounted optical beacon and a ground-based, actively-tracking Hartmann turbulence sensor. The Aret\u00e9 system will use proven Aret\u00e9 drone-tracking technology to maintain alignment with the beacon and a novel, high-bandwidth wavefront sensor design based on a modification of the typical Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. This new platform will enable the collection of the vertical C_n^2 profiles needed to assess lethality degradation probabilities in strategic areas of interest and support new HEL systems development."

        "Abstract": "Lidar operates as a pair of synchronized photon emitter and receiver, where the receiver detects the emitted photons reflected from the target. The photon emission is temporally modulated into pulses, and\u00a0the receiver detects the temporal modulation in the reflected photons and derives target range information, similar to the radar. The most common temporal modulation in lidars is by laser pulses and\u00a0synchronized time-of-flight range detection. The detection range is limited by the power of the photon source, optical aperture size and receiver sensitivity. The detection dynamic range (DR) must be very high\u00a0to simultaneously accommodate reflections from targets near and far. The proposed uncooled Photon-Sensing Integrated Circuit (PSIC) is an ultra-high-sensitivity, low-noise, high-DR and time-gated photodetector for 475nm lidars. Having proven the concept during Phase I, we\u00a0plan to\u00a0prototype and deliver during Phase II\u00a0the proposed uncooled, centimeter-sized, ultra-high-sensitivity, low-noise, high-DR, time-gated PSIC photodetector\u00a0and receiver for 475nm lidars. Continuing from\u00a0Phase I, we will (i) iteratively optimize, fabricate and characterize the PSIC of enhanced performance for photon-starved, high-DR and time-gated sensing in the\u00a0475nm spectral band, (ii) integrate with commercial-off-the-shelf trans-impedance amplifier, and (iii) deliver the integrated PSIC receiver to DoD during Phase II."

The proposed models account for both powder characteristics and AM processing\/path planning, including powder size distribution, laser power, scanning speed, scanning strategy, geometry features, and build orientation. Critical experiments will be performed during the course of this research as part of verification and validation. The goal of this D2M2 computational framework is to predict and optimize component-level surface roughness within a reasonable time. Proposed D2M2 computational framework will address surface roughness caused by rippling marks, balling effect, staircase effect, and sintered powders. Solution for the D2M2 framework will be obtained by discrete element method (DEM), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), finite element method (FEM) and data-driven modeling."

        "Abstract": "To address the Navy\u2019s need for non-destructive technology for detection of inclusion content in high-grade steel components, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (Intellisense), proposes to continue, in Phase II, the development of its Nondestructive Inclusion Detector (INTER) system based on the innovative use of picosecond laser ultrasonic methods for generating high-frequency acoustic signals needed to detect micron-size inclusions. It uses machine vision algorithms for acoustic pattern recognition, enabling fast and accurate detection of defects. In Phase I, Intellisense successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the INTER system. We documented the system requirements, analyzed parameters affecting its performance, developed a system architecture, and conducted breadboard demonstration of the prototype. Based on Phase I results, we identified an application scenario where INTER can be used to detect defects, at high resolution (0.001\u201d), in thin samples. In Phase II, Intellisense plans to advance, demonstrate, and evaluate the INTER system by incorporating several improvements to produce a mature INTER prototype, addressing the Navy\u2019s practical applications. During the Phase II Base period, Intellisense will refine the INTER system design, develop the primary hardware and software modules, including the design of a mechanical package for the INTER system. Intellisense will then test the INTER prototype on production size and grade blind steel samples to demonstrate non-destructive defect detection down to 0.001\u201d size on in-process (partially finished) and post-production components. During the Phase II Option 1, Intellisense will further customize the INTER system to address the practical applications in the intended environments such as steel manufacturing sites, component production sites, and repair facilities, and prepare the software and hardware subsystems for transition to INTER product development and low-rate production. Final testing will be perform that would include on-the-ground evaluation in fleet\/repair\/production environments; INTER will be also evaluated by first users such as GE Aviation Engines."

(ACT) has developed a low-cost LHP evaporator using a technique called Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), otherwise known as 3D printing.nbsp; With the capability of building a porous wick structure together with a solid wall via additive manufacturing, 3D printed LHP eliminates the knife edge seal as well as many wick manufacturing and testing steps.nbsp; The 3D printed LHP reduces the fabrication cost by an order of magnitude, which enables the use of LHPs in many emerging space applications, including CubeSats and SmallSats.nbsp;While the developed 3D printed loop heat pipe shows significant cost benefit compared to the loop heat pipe made by conventional fabrication process, the pore size of 3D printed primary is around 5~7 mu;m, much larger than the 1 mu;m pore size made by sintering process.nbsp; In addition, the porosity of the 3D printed primary wick is lower than sintering wick (31% vs. gt; 40%).nbsp; In order to apply this emerging technology to higher power, large satellite applications, which are the current main loop heat pipe market, further reduce pore size and increase porosity are needed."

        "Abstract": "Beam-driven wakefield accelerators, including SWFA (structure-based wakefield accelerator) and PWFA (plasma-based wakefield accelerator) are promising candidates for TeV-class high energy colliders. The enabling tool for a high efficiency and high gradient SWFA is a bunch shaper that produces a specifically shaped electron bunch or bunch train. A number of techniques have been explored to implement the bunch shaper. However, none of the existing methods are currently capable of shaping high-charge bunches (nC range, or equivalently kA range in pulsed current), and are far from the requirement of producing high gradient, G, (GV\/m) in realistic SWFA machine. We proposed a new Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR)-free longitudinal bunch shaping technique using transverse deflecting cavities. In this method, two deflectors and a quadruple magnet are used to introduces and exchange the z \u2212 x correlation, and a transverse mask tailors the longitudinal density profile. This method provides high-quality shaping regardless of charge level and preserves the beam quality. The only drawback of using a mask, which induces beam loss, will be significantly compensated by using the laser shaping technique that we are developing to generate and transport a longitudinally pre-formed bunch [24]. This integrated bunch shaping technique will eventually provide a solution for the previously unsolved issue of producing a high charge (&gt;10 nC, or equivalently &gt;1 kA before compression) shaped bunch. The principal objective of this project is to demonstrate a novel bunch-shaping technique that is capable of producing a high-charge (&gt;10 nC) shaped drive beam for beam-driven wakefield accelerators. The final deliverable will be a structure-based wakefield acceleration experiment that for the first time demonstrates a high transformer ratio (&gt;5) and a high gradient (&gt;200MV\/m). One of the key elements of this technique is a short pulse traveling-wave deflector that is powered by a wakefield power extractor, so that the entire scheme can naturally apply to the future SWFA project and facility. Under Phase I of this project, we will focus on two main tasks: 1) completion of the simulation and experimental layout based on the wakefield-driven short- pulse deflectors; 2) development of the short-pulse traveling-wave deflector. The techniques for producing a shaped high-charge drive bunch that we propose in this project can obtain a much higher energy transfer efficiency and a high gradient, leading to a breakthrough in the performance of wakefield accelerators."

        "Abstract": "In order to achieve sharp, high resolution real-time imaging, electron beams in a MeV UEM (ultrafast electron microscope) beamline need to minimize instabilities and energy spread during generation and acceleration. The stability of the normal conducting photocathode gun which is currently used to produce short electron bunches has been one of main elements limiting the further improvement of beam instability. The Superconducting RF (SRF) photocathode gun is a promising candidate to produce highly stable electrons for UEM\/UED applications. It operates in an ultrahigh Q, CW mode, and dissipates a few watts of RF power, which make it possible to achieve a 10s ppm level of beam stability by using modern RF control techniques. Following the Phase II work plan, we have accomplished the engineering design of the conduction-cooled SRF cavity in all possible practical aspects. We have measured the QE of Nb and Nb3Sn. We have fabricated the cryostat and Nb cavity, and completed infrastructure work to install the Cryocooler. The cryocooler and the cryostat were integrated. Both the cool-down test (to 4K) and the magnetic shielding (10^11 e-\/s) MeV UED\/UEM facility at BNL. Similarly to Phase II, this Phase IIA project will be a joint effort, and the close collaboration remains strong between BNL and Euclid. The development of MeV-range ultrafast electron diffraction\/microscopy (UED and UEM) has been identified as an enabling instrumentation in numbers of published DoE reports, which may lead to breakthroughs in fundamental science and applied technologies. The electron source we are proposing will significantly improve performance of the current MeV UEM."

        "Abstract": "Photocathodes excel at emitting bright electron beams, but transverse momenta are unavoidably nonzero. Ultra-low transverse emittance \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc5b,\ud835\udc65 would enable brighter, higher energy x-ray free electron lasers (FEL), better colliders, and more coherent, detailed ultrafast electron diffraction\/microscopy (UED\/UEM), unlocking new nanoscale discoveries. Maintaining high quantum efficiency (QE) avoids laser-induced nonlinearities. State- of-the-art is 100 pC bunches from copper (\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc5b,\ud835\udc65 0.4 \ud835\udf07m). Advances towards 0.1 \ud835\udf07m require ultra- low emittance, high QE, cryo-compatible materials. This proposal minimizes physical and chemical roughness of high QE alkali antimonides to reduce emittance. Single crystal epitaxial growth is planned through novel substrate lattice-matching and ion-beam-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (IBA-MBE). Such cathodes are anticipated to achieve excellent electron transport favorable for high QE and low emittance due to the single or large grain crystal structure with few grain boundaries and minimal crystal defects. It is anticipated that when operated cryogenically at high field, Cs3Sb intrinsic emittance can approach a record 0.1 \ud835\udf07m\/mm (5 meV mean transverse energy). Our objective was true epitaxial growth toward large grain or single crystal alkali antimonide photocathodes. We achieved (1) epitaxial growth on a new lattice- matched substrate with stunning 0.157 nm rms physical roughness and 4% QE in Cs3Sb, (2) the first-ever chemical roughness maps of an active alkali antimonide. (3) a near-zero calculated contribution to emittance from the measured roughness, even at higher field (\u226510 MV\/m), and (4) a feasible Phase II design for IBA-MBE. Based on these completed tasks and our innovative solutions we now have a clear path to product development and prototyping in Phase II. In Phase II, cryogenic 20 K gun test at 10 MV\/m field and high laser fluence will demonstrate ultra-low emittance of epitaxial cathodes. Single crystal IBA-MBE will measure crystallinity, stoichiometry, roughness, and band structure. A Monte Carlo model of emission will inform analysis. We will assess compatibility with superconducting RF photoinjectors, and open a production capability. Phase II will conclude with demonstrated ability to produce a new class of ultra-low emittance electron sources, well prepared to commercialize in Phase III. The potential market for high QE, low emittance photocathodes is significant. Such sources are of broad interest to light sources and accelerators, including SRF facilities such as SLAC&apos;s LCLS-II HE, Fermilab&apos;s IARC, and RF linac based FELs for industrial applications, as well as ultrafast UED\/UEM."

        "Abstract": "Next-generation of synchrotron and Free-Electron Laser X-ray sources will increase the peak power by several orders of magnitude. In these conditions, X-ray intensity will become too severe for the existing materials. Diamond is the most promising, if not only candidate, due to its high thermal conductivity, small thermal expansion, and low X-ray absorption. Unfortunately, the availability of large size, high-crystallinity, and low-defect density diamond substrates is very limited. Presently, there are no suppliers of high-quality diamonds with low defect concentrations in the United States to support this rapidly developing field of diamond X-ray optics applications for the next generation sources. We will develop the modified High-Pressure High-Temperature (HPHT) temperature gradient growth technology that will allow growing the highest crystalline quality large diamond crystals, with dislocation density less than 10 cm-2. Among two synthetic diamond lab-grown technologies, the HPHT approach is superior over CVD for X-ray applications due to its near-equilibrium growth nature that allows for large crystals with almost three orders of magnitude fewer defect densities than CVD-grown plates. The main prerequisite for the near dislocation-free HPHT diamond growth is a reduction of nitrogen impurities to less than 1 ppm-level. Unique total environmental control of all processing steps will be utilized to achieve required diamond crystal purity and structure perfection. In Phase I, an extensive process of modeling and optimization of TGG HPHT reactor geometry and growth parameters was conducted. We modeled temperature field distribution inside the HP chamber at different stages of diamond crystal growth. We identify conditions of cell geometry and ambient parameters necessary for increasing the crystal size. Despite COVID-19 obstacles, we were able to conduct two testing runs of HPHT crystal growth, optimized for reduced nitrogen contamination. In tight collaboration with the APS ANL team, the materials were characterized using several X-ray techniques. In addition, we performed optical cross-polarizer analysis, UV-light, and micro- Raman characterization of selected samples. We achieved very encouraging results: the grown crystals had already surpassed the sizes specified in the topic. The largest diamond plate cut from these crystals has dimensions 6.5x6.5x0.5 mm3. White-beam x-ray topography demonstrated near dislocation free quality, and analysis of spatial variations in the Bragg angle from the ideal direction was within 300 nrad\/mm2 for the best sample. In Phase II, we will address the remaining HP cell design and technological questions and build a custom HPHT diamond reactor system. Multiple optimization trials will be performed to identify the best growth conditions for large size high-quality diamonds. X-ray and other characterizations will be conducted and analyzed after each test. At the end of Phase II, we will be well prepared to scale up and commercialize high-quality diamond substrates for scientific applications. This project&apos;s long-term goal is to establish the first USA-based HPHT diamond growth facility capable of producing the highest quality large SC diamonds matching X-ray optics requirements. The technology developed here is required to utilize X-ray beams at fourth generation light sources to maximum potential. High-quality diamond is virtually the only material that can withstand the next- generation light sources&apos; heat load. If a manufacturing technology for large size HPHT diamond substrate is established, diamond-based optical elements will supersede the current silicon and beryllium alternatives, which have lower performance and severe health and safety concerns. High-quality diamond material will also benefit quantum computing, industrial, medical, and other industrial applications."

        "Abstract": "Electron cooling of the hadron beam is required in the next generation of electron-ion colliders (EICs) to maintain uninterrupted high luminosity. The method being pursued at Brookhaven Nation Laboratory\u2019s (BNL) EIC is based on coherent electron cooling (CeC) with a high bunch-charge Energy Recovery Linac (ERL). In Phase I, Xelera Research LLC worked closely with both BNL and Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) teams to study multiple concepts for the critical merger and arc sections of a high bunch charge ERL. These sections were designed using comprehensive modeling and global numerical optimization to suppress the detrimental effects of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) and space charge (SC). The Xelera team also began to develop a complete start-to-end design to set the stage for the Phase II project. In Phase II, we will partner with BNL scientists to develop complete ERL designs suitable for production use. The first year of the project will focus on the beam dynamics designs, including designs for the injector, merger, multi-pass Linac, merger into the cooling section, demerger into the return line (which includes 180-degree arcs), and final extraction of the energy recovered beam. These activities will blend into relevant beam dynamics studies in the second year, including beam breakup (BBU) simulations, tolerance studies, start-to-end simulations, and beam halo studies. A successful Phase II collaboration will establish Xelera Research LLC as an accelerator design and consulting firm that national labs and industry can reliably utilize for new projects. For example, an ERL-based Free Electron Laser (FEL) is considered to be a potential future path for a EUV lithography light source, and this project would position us to break into that industry. The team at Xelera Research LLC is experienced in designing and building innovative and record setting electron sources, injectors, and beam transport systems. While individuals at our firm are internationally recognized experts, it is our team as a whole that makes Xelera unique in this field."

        "Abstract": "Determination of gas concentrations and isotopologue ratios are a critical tool in plant, microbial and ecosystem ecology, hydrology, biogeochemistry studies, and interrogation of environmental remediation. In particular, real-time, high bandwidth, high sensitivity measurements of gases such as methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide concentrations in air, soil, and water interfaces to ppm concentrations at a number of points within a given spatial-region would be extremely valuable for a variety of applications and models. This is especially true for the complex coastal environment. Isotopic labeling of these gases would also improve the usefulness of this information. In this SBIR program, Amethyst will design, construct, and deploy a prototype low cost, high sampling rate and high resolution autonomous gas measurement system. The system will be composed of multiple inexpensive single gas measurement sensors that can be designed to rapidly measure CH4, N2O and the carbon isotopes of CO2 at trace levels. Multiple single gas sensors can be placed at various locations and run by a base station. These low power automated gas measurements systems can be networked together with each system utilizing multiple senor heads that can be placed at multiple above and below ground locations as well as water interfaces. These sensor systems can be wirelessly connected to the main control system that can record the gas concentrations and CO2 isotopologue ratio at various sites in real time. The networked system will be able to operate unattended and upload data to the cloud so these gases can be monitored 24\/7. Measurement speeds can be in the hertz range. During Phase I program Amethyst will build and test a demonstration resonant cavity photodetector-based gas sensor capable of detecting methane. Amethyst will also design the networked multi-gas sensor system and investigate an overall system design to optimize detection speed and sensitivity for a number of gases (CH4, 12CO2, 13CO2, and N2O). The Phase II program will construct the multi-point, multi gas networked sensor system then test and validate the sensor system in a field environment. The development of an inexpensive portable autonomous highly-sensitive multi-point and multi-gas sensor system capable of measurement of gases for monitoring microbial bio gases in soils, the air-water interface and in the air will be of very high value to the environmental, agricultural and biochemistry community. Development of gas sensors based on resonant cavity enhanced photodetectors will replace the expensive MWIR laser with a simple, inexpensive light emitting diode (LED), which will provide high sensitivity detection capabilities at a fraction of the cost of existing systems. After demonstration of high sensitivity CO2 N2O and CH4 detectors, the design can be extended to monitor other above and below ground gases with great utility in many industries where environmental monitoring is required."

        "Abstract": "In a Fast-Light Ring Laser Gyroscope (FRLG), the group index is vanishingly small.nbsp; The Sagnac effect induced shift in the resonance frequency of each of two counter-propagating lasers, for a given rotation rate, is amplified by a factor equaling the inverse of this group index, compared to that for a conventional ring laser gyroscope (RLG).nbsp; This scale factor enhancement coefficient (SFEC) can be as high as a million.nbsp; If the quantum noise limited uncertainty in the laser frequency for an FRLG is the same as that for an RLG for otherwise identical operating parameters, this would imply that the factor of enhancement in measurement precision (FEMP) for an FRLG is the same as the SFEC.nbsp; However, based on analogy with similar effects in a parity-time symmetric system, it has been suggested that the quantum noise limited uncertainty for an FRLG may be larger than that for an RLG, due to the so-called Petermann factor, thereby reducing the FEMP to a value smaller than the SFEC.nbsp; We will carry out theoretical as well as experimental work to establish the maximum possible value of the FEMP that can be achieved under experimentally achievable conditions.nbsp; In one track, we will carry out two new types of theoretical modeling for the FRLG to determine how the FEMP varies as a function of the operating parameters: one based on propagating the field using a quantum-enabled finite division time domain technique in the presence of random spontaneous emissions of photons, and the other based on re-ordering the operators in the temporal correlation function.nbsp; In the second track, we will use a robust version of a Rb based superluminal laser, which employs a cavity enclosed in a vacuum chamber and highly stabilized pump lasers, to measure the value of the FEMP.nbsp; The measurements will be compared with the theoretical models, and used to guide modifications thereof until agreement is achieved.nbsp; This will pave the way for further refinement and miniaturization of the FRLG in Phase II."

        "Abstract": "We will develop a three-axes superluminal inertial measurement unit (SIMU), employing three chip-scale superluminal ring laser gyroscopes and accelerometers (SRLGA). Each SRLGA will make use of miniature Rubidium vapor cells, and integrated photonic technology (IPT) based components. The IPT components include narrow-band lasers, detectors, low-loss waveguides, and magneto-optic isolators, integrated on a single chip, operating at 780\/795 nm. AlGaAsP Quantum Wells (QWs) will enable the realization of the active photonic components. In sections for the passive components, the QWs would be disordered to minimize optical losses. A resonator containing two miniature vapor cells will be used as the cavity for the two superluminal ring lasers, the beat-note between which will yield the rotation rate. One of the mirrors for the cavity will be mounted on a metallic diaphragm for accelerometry. The chip-mounted components will be interconnected with the cavity, as well as additional electronics on a printed circuit board, for off-set phase locking of lasers, locking to atomic transitions, and processing of rotation and acceleration data. During Phase I, we have established the feasibility of developing the necessary IPT components, including demonstrations of lasers, waveguides and detectors, thus paving the way for realizing the chip-scale SRLGA and the SIMU during"

        "Abstract": "For navigation under GPS denied conditions, there is a need for better inertial sensors.\u00a0 Over the last few years, with support from NASA, MDA, DARPA and AFOSR, and different branches of AFRL, namely AFRL\/RVSVC and AFRL\/RWWG, and in collaboration with Honeywell, we at Digital Optics Technologies (DOT), in partnership with Northwestern University (NU), have been developing a superluminal laser accelerometer and gyroscope (SLAG) that can improve the accuracy of rotation sensing and accelerometry by as much as six orders of magnitude.\u00a0 Alternatively, for a given level of sensitivity, the SLAG can be very small.\u00a0 The process that makes the SLAG so sensitive is critically tuned anomalous dispersion, corresponding to group velocity of light far exceeding the vacuum speed of light. \u00a0This is the so-called fast-light effect. This dispersion is produced by introducing a narrow dip in the gain profile.\u00a0 This is made possible by using a combination of Raman gain in one isotope of Rb, and Raman depletion in another isotope of Rb, via careful juxtaposition of non-degenerate quantum transitions in these isotopes.\u00a0 Previously, we had built a compact SLAG;\u00a0 however, it was not optimized enough to achieve quantum noise limited sensitivity.\u00a0 During the initial four months of Phase I, we improved the stability of the SLAG by employing a vacuum enclosed, magnetically shielded cavity mounted on an Invar base.\u00a0 We have also developed improved servos,\u00a0 achieving temperature stability of ~0.05 deg C for the gain cells, limited by measurement accuracy, and frequency stability of ~15 kHz for the pump lasers, exceeding the stated goal of 50 kHz. \u00a0We have also developed a comprehensive numerical code for modeling accurately the behavior of the SLAG, which takes into account all Zeeman sublevels, and can be used to determine how the behavior of the SLAG varies as functions of temperature, residual magnetic field, and power and frequency of pump lasers.\u00a0 \u00a0By the end of Phase I, we expect to demonstrate, using this highly stable SLAG, an enhancement in sensitivity by a factor of ~one hundred thousand, under quantum noise limited conditions, thus establishing the feasibility of using three SLAGs to realize a three-axes superluminal inertial measurement unit (SIMU) for GPS denied navigation.\u00a0 In Phase II, we will combine three SLAGs, oriented orthogonally to one another, to realize a three-axes Superluminal Inertial Measurement Unit (SIMU), within a volume of one liter (10 cm X 10 cm X 10 cm), with a sensitivity to rotation and acceleration that far exceeds, by as much as five orders of magnitude, \u00a0that of the state of the art IMUs.\u00a0 Currently, AFOSR is supporting our work on developing chip-scale integrated photonic technology based components; this technology will enable further miniaturization of the SIMU.\u00a0 We have two patents issued this year for the core technologies underlying the SLAG.\u00a0 Prof. Selim Shahriar of NU, the inventor of the SLAG, is the PI for this project."

        "Abstract": "To address the Army\u2019s need for a beaconless tactical turbulence sensor capable of measuring range-resolved Cn2 over path lengths of 0.5 to 10\u00a0km with 10\u00a0m range resolution, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (Intellisense) proposes, in Phase II, to advance development of the Beaconless Tactical Turbulence Lidar (BEATTL) proven feasible in Phase I. The BEATTL system is based on backscattering amplification phenomena in the turbulent atmosphere that is directly related to the magnitude of the refractive index structure parameter. Atmospheric turbulence along the laser path is a key limiting factor for lethality and, as such, knowledge of the turbulence is a critical input for the fire control system. The innovative design of the compact BEATTL system enables it to operate 24\/7 in a field environment, providing the range-resolved values of the refractive index structure parameter along its line of sight with a data update rate of a few seconds. In Phase I, the BEATTL feasibility was demonstrated through sensor modeling, selection of major components, design, and simulation of the operational parameters in various weather conditions. In Phase II, Intellisense will fabricate the eye-safe lidar prototype and will test and validate its operation at military test ranges to demonstrate lidar effectiveness for the prediction of laser weapon system\u2019s efficiency. In Phase III, Intellisense will work with the Army prime contractor(s) on the integration of BEATTL into high-energy laser weapon systems."

        "Abstract": "This Phase I proposal aims to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of Fluorescence Enhanced Photothermal Infrared\n(FE-PTIR) imaging and spectroscopy. The proposed FE-PTIR will use fluorescence microscopy to map the distribution of\nfluorescently labeled regions of cells and tissue and then provide chemical structural analysis of the labeled regions using\nphotothermal infrared spectroscopy. Fluorescence microscopy is a cornerstone technique in biological research, allowing\nsensitive and highly specific mapping of target biomolecules within cells and tissue, but it does not provide information\nabout the chemical structure of those molecules. Infrared spectroscopy can provide rich analysis of chemical structure\nand has been used in life sciences research to study tissue classification, drug\/tissue interaction, neurodegenerative\ndiseases, cancer research and other areas. Conventional infrared spectroscopy, however, has a fundamental limit on its\nspatial resolution (i.e. roughly how small an object it can analyze) of around 10 micrometers, similar to the size of an\naverage biological cell. Thus conventional infrared spectroscopy has been extremely limited for many biomedical\napplications where the structures of interest are smaller than the size of a cell.\nThe proposed FE-PTIR technique will overcome the limitation of both fluorescence microscopy and infrared spectroscopy\nto provide highly specific mapping of target biomolecules along with chemical structural analysis of those molecules, both\nwith the same spatial resolution as fluorescence microscopy. This project will achieve this breakthrough by using a novel\nform of optical photothermal infrared spectroscopy to measure infrared spectra of fluorescently labeled regions of a\nsample. Specifically, the FE-PTIR technique will illuminate a sample with an infrared laser source that can be tuned to\nexcite molecular vibrations a sample of interest. A separate ultraviolet\/visible light source will be used for two jobs: (1) to\nexcite fluorescent emission in fluorescently labeled regions of the sample; and (2) measure a localized heating resulting\nfrom absorption of infrared radiation. By measuring the intensity of fluorescent light emitted from different regions of the\nsample, it is possible to map the distribution of fluorescently labeled biomolecules. Then by measuring subtle changes in\nthe amount of UV\/visible light collected from the sample resulting from the local IR-induced heating, it is possible to\ngenerate infrared absorption spectra of the same locations and with the same spatial resolution. The infrared absorption\nspectrum can then be used to analyze the chemical structure of the fluorescently labeled regions of the sample. This\nproject is well aligned with NIH goals as it incorporates several key thrusts of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging\nand Bioengineering, including optical imaging and spectroscopy, IR imaging, confocal microscopy, and multimodal\nimaging. FE-PTIR will be extremely useful for example in localizing specific proteins with fluorescence microscopy and then\nanalyzing using photothermal IR spectroscopy to analyze their structure, for example how the protein is folded. Protein\nmisfolding is a root cause of many neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer\u2019s) and FE-PTIR will offer new insights.\nDemonstrating the FE-PTIR technology will enable a new multimodal microscope with sub-cellular resolution that will offer\nprofound benefits for biomedical research including neurodegenerative diseases and antimicrobial resistance research.Project narrative\nFluorescence microscopy is a cornerstone technique in biological research that maps the distribution of\nfluorescently labeled biomolecules but does not provide information on their chemical structure. Infrared\nspectroscopy provides detailed chemical structural analysis on biological materials, but fundamental\nresolution limits have constrained its application in biology. This SBIR project will overcome these limits\nto enable both mapping and chemical analysis of target biomolecules with sub-micron spatial resolution,\nthus enabling research to provide fundamental insights into neurodegenerative diseases and\nantimicrobial resistance."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to fully automate frequent and regular disinfection tasks in hospitals, care centers, commercial units, universities, schools, and other indoor spaces. This task has become critically important in light of the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. By being fully automated, the proposed robotic system reduces human risk and required protective gear (as humans do not need to enter a contaminated zone to move in and position their devices) as well as human workload (due to autonomous operation of the robot system). Current Ultra-Violet C (UVC) disinfection robots utilize integrated bulbs and have limited operation intervals due to the need to frequently recharge, the proposed solution is able to operate a wide variety of disinfection devices like UVC lamps, High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, hydrogen peroxide aerosols, and others, and thus, offers maximum versatility to the customer while also allowing for the utilization of the customer\u2019s existing devices. In addition, the assistive system can be instructed in natural language by non-experts and can thus be operated without prior training. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop two autonomous robots that, together, can carry out room disinfection tasks with existing equipment. One challenge with automating disinfection, especially UVC disinfection, is the power consumption of UVC lights and the need for frequent recharging of battery-operated units on autonomous robots. Another is that current robotic solutions have UVC devices integrated, which prevents the use of existing or custom devices. The solution to both challenges is to build a flat carrier robot where existing or custom devices can be mounted and a second robot, tethered to the carrier robot, that can power the device by docking at a purpose-made docking station connected to a wall outlet. While the device is on, both robots will also be able to recharge their batteries and thus operate continuously. Advanced navigation strategies are necessary to ensure that both robots can drive through indoor environments to their target locations without tangling the tether. Both robots will be equipped with laser and camera sensors and utilize joint sensor information communicated via their tether for improving localization and navigation. The result will be a robust autonomous multi-robot system for navigation and disinfection tasks. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "This STTR proposal addresses the need for a robust, reliable, light-weight hand-held water sensor for screening of Toxic Organic Chemicals \/ Toxic Organic Matter (TICs\/TIMs) in filtered water supplies that are available to the Soldier in an operational setting.\u00a0 While recent investment in filtration technologies by the US Army led to the development of (TICs\/TIMs) filters that are compatible with the MOLLE hydration pack filtration systems, there is no way to asses the continued efficacy of the filtration systems. At the same time, if the filtration media is saturated or breached, this can put the Soldiers at risk for acute or chronic health effects if they choose to drink the water without any knowledge of the risks. We propose development of a sensor designed to assess water quality after filtering. The proposed sensor is based on cost-effective, on-chip, miniature infrared photonics integrated circuit (IR-PIC). The proposed IR-PIC platform is based on integrated infrared quantum cascade laser (QCL), IR waveguides and Quantum Cascade Detector (QCD) on a single semiconductor chip. The sensing of the TICs\/TIMs is based on the vibrational analysis of infrared absorption bands. Pre-concentration of TICs\/TIMs in the selective materials enables enhanced sensitivity and selectivity to toxic contaminants. Overall, the proposed sensor is expected to provide measurements of the representative classes of TICs\/TIMs (heavy metal, organophosphate, volatile), and salt in any source water."

        "Abstract": "Technology Assessment and Transfer, Inc. in collaboration with the University of Cincinnati and industrial partner Carrier proposes the development and demonstration of light weight, compact additive manufactured (AM) alumina ceramic heat exchangers with exceptional heat transfer properties for a broad spectrum of residential and industrial air to refrigerant HVAC applications. The higher thermal conductivity, dimensional stability, low thermal expansion, corrosion resistance and light weight of alumina makes it the preferred choice over high temperature metals. The proposed approach includes the following tasks: 1)Develop models of compact heat exchanger designs that capitalize on digital light projection (DLP) AM capabilities and predict thermal performance improvements over traditional sheet metal designs, 2) Fabricate sub-scale DLP heat exchanger designs, 3) Measure performance (pressure drop and heat transfer) in in a low-speed air-flow wind tunnel, 4) Compare performance to modeling predictions, 5) Identify dimensional shortfalls relative to design requirements and 6) Prepare a Final Report with all the results, analyses, conclusions and recommendations for accelerated, scale up Phase 2 effort. In Phase 2 UC will incorporate the most up-to-date fabrication capabilities into the designs (e.g. minimum feature size limit, minimum channel size, microstructure, properties) for scale up and testing by Carrier. Commercial applications of these highly efficient, microchannel ceramic heat exchangers will produce substantial energy savings in residential and commercial heat pumps and air conditioners. In addition, spin off opportunities include industrial, automobile, truck. aircraft engine and geothermal heat recovery. Other applications include electronic power modules, radar, laser and other systems with substantial cooling needs."

        "Abstract": "The long-term goal of this application is to advance full noncontact laser ultrasound (LUS) imaging from first in the world human demonstration to an instrument able to image the wounded at the point of care on the battlefield, and to deploy a new clinical imaging modality to provide new insight about the body. The military field medic must rapidly triage the wounded soldier. Ultrasound is an imaging tool which can help the medic to assess the wounds of the soldier and direct urgent evacuation and prioritize care. Ultrasound imaging advantages include that it is non-invasive, employs no radiation or contrast agents, and is inexpensive. Modern electronics enable the creation of small systems. Nevertheless, ultrasound limitations include required contact between probe and patient, the use of gel to serve as a coupling agent, and the skill level of the provider and variability in probe placement. Laser Ultrasound (LUS) addresses these limitations. LUS employs a completely different signal generation and detection technology, with advantages for the battlefield and other clinical uses. LUS uses only light, transmitted through air, to both generate and detect acoustic vibrations in the body. It only needs to be moved above the patient, with no connecting medium required, no physical contact. This is advantageous in cases where skin contact is prohibited due to burns or blast debris wounds. In LUS, we restrict optical to acoustic conversion to the tissue surface and solely interrogate underlying tissue with sound. We demonstrated the first fully eye- and skin-safe non-contact US imaging technique, enabled by laser generation and detection of sound. LUS is a groundbreaking addition to the arsenal of tools available to the medic, radiologist, surgeon, and general clinician, and enables new uses for ultrasound while addressing current ultrasound limitations. We propose to perform a feasibility study for the development of a handheld LUS scanning device \u2013 hardware and software subsystems, interfaces, and integrated system. We combine our commercialization experience, foundational work and detailed understanding of the LUS technology required, and work to translate LUS from our lab to the battlefield, to the field hospital, and to general clinical use. We propose to 1) evaluate the feasibility of the miniaturization, and integration of the optical and electronics hardware and software components and subsystems, that are the unique to LUS; 2) design the front-end interface and back-end data acquisition electronics and image reconstruction pipeline for LUS - similar to conventional US, but with some critical differences; 3) analyze the tradeoffs between techniques for image acquisition and image reconstruction; 4) evaluate the feasibility of a fully integrated compact design. We highlight the framework and roadmap for how to apply machine learning to the automated analysis of the LUS images."

        "Abstract": "Solutions are sought by the Navy to introduce a new design and\/or new technologies to improve transformer-rectifier (T\/R) maintainability, with a focus on modularity, hatchability, temperature regulation, and simplicity.\u00a0The proposed solution by American Maglev Technology of Florida (AMT) and the University of Houston\u00a0incorporates HTS-based transformers, coupled with LRU control unit partitioning, to minimize size and weight to meet design criteria. These HTS based transformers would be air core, not steel core, and thus eliminating weight and volume of the steel core of the conventional transformer. Air does not magnetically saturate, and so it is possible to attain required magnetic flux levels in smaller volumes. The use of HTS conductors in the transformers allows for much smaller conductors than conventional transformers and thus can be accomplished in a smaller volume.\u00a0The true value of the following proposal is in the correlation of three areas. First, high temperature superconducting (HTS) tape development has reached a high point in its development. Our team is capable of sending a huge current through Rare Earth Barium Copper Oxide (REBCO) superconductor tape that is 4 mm wide and 1 mm thick, current ranging from 1,000 A to 6,500 A. Second, we know how to striate these tiny tapes with lasers so they can carry ac current at 60 Hz with minimal loss. Third, we know how to configure arrange these small tapes into a combination of solenoids as subunits and toroids as larger units arranged using a multi-turn reel so the magnetic field is self-contained. The result is high performance and light weight for applications such as transformers. All this is within the domain of high temperature superconductors, which can be achieved using ubiquitous, simple liquid air (N2) cryogenics. Manufacturing fabrication has caught up with this progress to the point that hundreds of kilometers of tape are available on the market today. This enables the attainability of powerful, lightweight transformers for the first time."

The seed laser is capable of supporting WDM across all CCSDS PPM pulse formats. These enhancements increase the data capacity scaling by gt;10x over the current state of the art high power WDM transmitter enabling the next generation of high speed DSOC links. In addition, the seed laser module can also be operated using On-Off keying at much higher data rates then PPM. With minor adjustment at gt;gt; 100 Gbps using coherent coms can be achieved as well as DPSK waveforms.NASArsquo;s Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) roadmap for 2025 and beyond shows the need for optical links for Earth, lunar, inter-planetary, and relay networks requiring 10-100x higher data rates than current state-of-the-art space-based optical communications systems. Future laser communications system requirements include data rates gt;1 Gbps downlink from planetary bodies, and gt;100 Gbps low-geosynchronous earth orbit (LEO-GEO) networks. To support high-data-rate communications for long-range GEO and inter-planetary missions, a new class of laser communications transmitter is required with high average power (gt;20 W), high efficiency (gt;20%), and high peak power (gt;1 kW)mdash;and capable of 16-ary and 128-ary pulse position modulation (PPM) formats. Wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) systems must also have output power that is spectrally flat with minimal cross-talk."

        "Abstract": "Fibertek proposes a novel architecture which relies on advancements in fiber technology to dramatically improve the efficiency of the IR stage of green light generation.\u00a0 By removing the comparatively lossy solid-state amplifier, this architecture can achieve more than double the efficiency of current state-of-the-art high energy systems while maintaining a comparatively small footprint.\u00a0 In addition, as the only free space components in the system are the in the SHG module, the system is comparatively resistant to vibration, which can be critical for fielding.\u00a0This architecture benefits from Fibertek\u2019s expertise in pulsed fiber amplifiers.\u00a0 The fiber amplifier requires seed energy for efficient extraction.\u00a0 Fibertek has demonstrated the capability for such amplifiers already.\u00a0 Multiple stages of amplification will be used. The output of the final amplifier will split to be able to seed multiple amplifiers individually."

With the ability to generate any pulse sequence \u2018on-the-fly\u2019 entirely through software, the technology opens up the possibility of transmission of metadata from designator to seeker. Due to high energy and flexible pulse modulation output, the laser meets requirements for next generation laser designators as well as provides the Air Force critical benefits in several application areas such as laser ranging, sensor defeat, and infrared countermeasures. Further, the technology will serve as a novel research and development tool for Air Force for exploring metadata transmission and exploring novel pulse coding techniques for development of advanced seekers."

        "Abstract": "Fluid cells flanked by thin membranes transparent to electron or X-ray beams have been developed in the past for microscopy and spectral analyses of liquid\/gaseous samples, interfaces, and atomic\/molecular- scale reactions, to support 1 bar pressure differences, as suited for work in regular vacuum chambers. Many technological and environmentally-important phenomena (e.g. high-pressure underground mineralization, catalysis and reactions at high pressure, etc.), would require greatly improved leak- free\/vacuum-safe new MHPFCs to allow multi-reactant\/electrode studies of the same type, at pressures of hundreds of bar. The subject of this Phase I SBIR is the development of such cells. Membranes can be made to resist pressure by reducing their size and increasing their thickness, but for 300+ bar and a reasonable effective analysis area, with constraint in thickness to tens to hundreds of nm due to transmission requirements, one needs to cleverly solve the compromise between thickness and area, bringing into play thickness distributions and corner reinforcements within a computer-based optimization. The approach will seek to eliminate stress concentrations at the membrane edges by precisely adjusting the membrane thickness, shape, residual stress, and composition. Optimized membranes will be integrated into fully-functional MHPFCs by bonding two identical Si parts, including each 4 feed-through channels, electrical leads\/connection pads, and a pressure sensor, then assembled the bonded Si parts with ISO-guidelines-compliant fluid and electrical connectors. Various specific mounts for X-ray and electron beam requirements will be developed. During Phase I, membrane optimization will be accomplished in collaboration with Northwestern University, who has expertise in membrane deflection, size effects for ultra-thin structures, stress engineering and simulations. Alcorix will manufacture and validate the membranes in-house with a high- pressure bulging setup, while also fabricating working\/testable chips with simple membranes and no pressure sensor. During Phase II, a family of range- and purpose-customized devices with engineered membranes and integrated pressure sensors will be fabricated and tested, leading to a family of products. Potential customers for MHPFCs include: beam line scientists, electron microscopists, scientists from high-energy laser facilities, and many diverse labs \u2013 a community which Alcorix currently serves. While simple fluid cells withstanding only 1 bar and no microfluidics\/electrodes can be low cost, (~$59\/pc), the targeted cells are high-value, due to their exquisite features (&gt;300 bar, multifluidic ports, multielectrode, integrated pressure sensor, plug-in ready). The estimated global market is ~$2.5M today and up to $8.1M in 10 years, out of which Alcorix can capture 100% as unique producer or 75% as producer and licensee."

Our design will incorporate features that will radically improve the trap operational capabilities over today\u2019s standards. The trapping zone will be cut up into spatially distinctive sections, each of which will be optimized for performing a specific task. This will provide a capability that, so far, has been offered only by a few surface traps. Furthermore, unlike surface traps, our 3D design will offer advantages such as low heating rates, very efficient screening from stray electric fields, deep trapping potentials, and broad optical access. Our design will also include a means to efficiently dissipate heat, as required for stable trapping fields and reliable entangling operations. It will include a mechanism to control the trap frequency, which otherwise drifts as a result of unwanted fluctuations of the rf voltage, and it will incorporate some optical functionalities including laser beam application, and\/or photon collection for state detection or remote entanglement. This trap, being monolithic, will require no assembly and it will fulfill the required micron-tolerances in positions of the different charge-carrying elements in all three dimensions across the entirety of the structure. This monolithic approach completely eliminates the severe internal alignment issues associated with all traditional (i.e. hand-assembled) blade traps."

        "Abstract": "Even though gaseous methane (CH4) is a comparatively sparse constituent in Earthrsquo;s atmosphere, it is the third most impactful greenhouse gas after water vapor and carbon dioxide, and the second most important in terms of anthropogenic drivers.nbsp; Methane is some 60 times more effective than CO2 in absorbing long-wavelength radiation, because the methane absorption lines in that part of the spectrum are less saturated and have less overlap with water vapor lines.nbsp; Natural and agricultural sources of methane continue to dominate, but are difficult to separate and quantify.nbsp; World-wide, rice cultivation, biomass burning, ruminant farm animals, and fossil fuel mining and usage have long been the most powerful drivers, but with climate change these sources could be dwarfed in the future by the release of enormous quantities of methane from melting permafrost and\/or methane hydrates currently buried deep in ocean sediment.nbsp; Innovative new remote sensing technologies need to address the atmospheric methane concentration measurement problem for NASA and other applications.Beyond Photonics proposes to investigate specific very compact pulsed oscillator\/amplifier designs near the 1.645-micron wavelengths of interest by NASA for atmospheric methane (CH4) and potentially coherent winds in the same nominal wavelength region.nbsp; Specifically, methane concentration measurement from operational platforms of NASArsquo;s choice will be our focus; this application puts particular emphasis on decreasing size, weight, and prime power (SWaP) and eliminating active laser component cooling.nbsp; Particular emphasis will also be placed on ensuring that the laser\/lidar designs are compatible with scaling to space qualification in future programs.nbsp; Emphasis will also be placed on technical approaches with good operational flexibility in terms of pulse energy and duration, frequency agility, and application to other IR and SWIR wavelengths.nbsp;"

        "Abstract": "Improved long-range detection, tracking, and discrimination of targets is needed from missiles while in flight. The operational significance in developing this capability is to greatly improve the probability of successful target intercept \u2013 providing better target detection, tracking and false-target discrimination than is possible with the currently existing, or even moderately upgraded, on-board sensors. Our solution to this problem is a compact, efficient, functionally-integrated coherent detection ladar subsystem that meets and exceeds the stated customer specifications and adds the capability of precision Doppler which aids in target identification and discrimination. The benefit to MDA of this development effort is the near-term availability of a sensor that can be integrated with future on-board missile sensors, can detect targets to 200 km range, can mitigate interference, can provide very-high-accuracy closing velocity (~ 1 cm\/s) and fine range resolution (15 cm) and range precision (~ 1 cm), and is compatible with the harsh missile operating environment. The precision velocity measurement capability of the proposed coherent ladar significantly improves target identification and discrimination and inherently offers additional enhanced measurement modalities including range Doppler imaging. Innovations realized in this development program include the capability to provide target detection at low transmitted peak power compatible with highly-efficient all fiber transmitters, high range resolution and precision. These innovations come via the evolution of a single photon sensitive coherent detection ladar, an efficient high-power Thulium-doped, large-mode-area (LMA) fiber amplifier, wide-band transmitted signal modulation, high-stability programmable reference lasers, and compact and efficient state-of-the art integrated circuits allowing for very compact high-bandwidth signal acquisition and processing. In Phase I, Beyond Photonics (BP) performed trade studies, analysis and modeling, and developed a conceptual design of the proposed ladar. In Phase II we propose to develop a realistic ladar subsystem brass-board and demonstrate that it can achieve the above noted performance in lab and ground-based field testing.

        "Abstract": "It is important for United States to maintain an asymmetric warfighting advantage throughout its armed forces by having both advanced weaponry and defense capabilities in all strategic scenarios. High Energy Laser (HEL) capabilities have been demonstrated both domestically and abroad and represent a unique directed energy weapon with speed-of-light attack capability, potentially rendering many technologies ineffective or obsolete.\u00a0 Therefore, to maintain strategic global dominance, we must provide a defense solution against this advancing class of weapons. The cumulative work of Phase I &amp; II has yielded the development of a non-sacrificial reflective optical limiter which mitigates laser damage with an intrinsically higher damage tolerance than a traditional absorptive optical limiter. Current results have demonstrated a system concept at a variety of potential HEL wavelengths, including visible, NIR, and SWIR, and is further tailorable to MWIR and LWIR. Multi-bandpass and broadband mirrors have been developed to enable usage in complex sensor systems and simultaneously protect against several common HEL wavelengths. Preliminary HEL testing has shown coatings withstanding the maximum available irradiance with no signs of failure or change in performance.\u00a0 The proposed Phase IIS work will expand on these results through application specific development and environmental testing and will culminate in tailored coatings supplied on prototype geometries. Environmental testing includes HEL multi-hit, thermomechanical, and high-G durability testing. Application specific development includes the optimization of nonlinear optical behavior for tailored dynamic range, as well as prototype scaling and testing."

        "Abstract": "Laser or GPS guided seeker algorithms override the nonlinear control algorithms to acquire and strike the target. They are a one-to-one weapon-target acquisition technique dependent strike. Further, the combat pilot in short range targets is required to coordinate with the fire control system, acquisition, engagement, etc., all simultaneously that are time critical for both human and the machine. Current trends in Cooperative Autonomy of weapons to strike a target-web demand loitering control algorithms onboard weapons until the human intelligence prioritize a target-web. For the human controller in this process, prioritization does not guarantee acquisition for a seeker algorithm to be active. Thus, there is a need to study extended stability region-based nonlinear control algorithms to work in conjunction with the seeker algorithms. Unfortunately, stability regions in which the weapons need to reside is an ambiguous problem prompting industries to discover more and more sensor innovations for a given airframe of the weapon. In one of the reviews of the SMARTOOLS publications, SpaceX is known to utilize extended stability region optimizers for its boosters to land on the targeted geo-coordinates. Target-web acquisition problem is similar in nature as far as stationary targets are concerned. The rationale of SMARTOOLS is to engage these revolutionary sensor and airframe platforms along with the stability regions, wherein, weapons can cooperatively acquire target-web through machine intelligence and strike by activating seeker algorithms. Thus, launch is assumed from F-15EX\u2019s with dozen missiles (assume they are a combination of Laser and GPS guided) or from F-16 or F-35\u2019s four missiles on its carriage in addition to their bombs.\u00a0 SMARTOOLS is confident in developing these new approaches by using the results it has. It provides a Nyquist like plot in time domain when the state-space model that derives transfer function matrix for the plot is uncertain or varying. This theory is friendly to determine extended stability regions for a nonlinear weapon when model and control parameters are either uncertain or orchestrated (patent pending, July 7, 2020). The concern in our context is, how a stability region-based loitering control algorithm after an inputted target-web is acquired would activate the seeker algorithm for a target-web strike? While the seeker algorithm is known to guarantee autonomy or semi-autonomy for a target-web strike, cooperative loitering algorithms in stability regions would guarantee acquisition for seeker to be effective. It is the novelty of this proposal. The stability margins supplement commands. Specifically, phase margin is command input-specific which will be utilized for the target-web acquisition in the stability regions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

        "Abstract": "Diamond has proven to be a superb material for cathodes.\u00a0 Experiments have demonstrated the ability of diamond wafers to emit over 200 secondary electrons for each primary electron that enters the wafer.\u00a0 These secondary electrons emerge from the diamond with very low energy and very low energy spread, thereby creating a high-quality electron beam (e-beam) with inherently low emittance.\u00a0 Thus, a diamond electron amplifier (DEA) is able to convert a poor quality primary e-beam, such as from a thermionic gun, into a high-quality e-beam with much higher charge than the primary e-beam.\u00a0 Moreover, this e-beam quality can be better than the quality from photocathodes, and does not require a complex UV laser system to drive the process.\u00a0 Diamond has high thermal conductivity, which permits effective cooling to minimize thermal emittance.\u00a0 Unlike bi-alkali photocathodes, diamond cathodes are very robust with the potential for long lifetimes.\u00a0 The primary objective during Phase II is to build and test a DEA electron source prototype that was analyzed and designed during Phase I.\u00a0 The prototype will deliver 100 keV electrons at 3 MHz repetition rate with an average current of 0.3 mA and a peak current of &gt;100 mA.\u00a0 This satisfies the target specifications for the Phase II prototype.\u00a0 In addition, preliminary lifetime data will be obtained."

        "Abstract": "High entropy alloys (HEAs) with three or more elements in equal concentrations have been observed to provide excellent shielding to ionizing radiation. These alloys have unique combinations of functional properties such as extremely high hardness, work hardening capacity, elevated temperature strength, ductility, toughness, excellent wear resistance, and superior corrosion resistance, all which could make their use as plasma facing component (PFC) for fusion reactors ideal. The broad design space for HEAs, however, remains relatively unexplored and much work still needs to be done to identify producible alloys with the properties needed for PFCs. Manufacturing processes for making real world HEA components are also quite immature, and approaches used for conventional alloys are currently used by default. A novel tungsten-based HEA was recently shown by scientists at LANL to be able to withstand unprecedented amounts of radiation without damage. This material, created as a thin film, is a quaternary nanocrystalline W-Ta-V-Cr alloy. The HEA retained outstanding mechanical properties after irradiation, and could be an excellent HEA for use as PFCs. To manufacture this HEA coating, a novel, in-situ process will be developed simultaneously. The in-situ HEA coating technology developed will also serve as the foundation for powerful and versatile new method to manufacture a wide array of HEA coatings with countless elemental combinations. In collaboration with LANL, the Phase I work will demonstrate the potential of the new HEA coating for PFCs. A unique process combination of high pressure cold spray (CS) and laser surface melting (LSM) will be used. Once deposited, the fundamental microstructure of the coatings will be evaluated, and then mechanical testing will be conducted to obtain properties data. The Phase I work will also develop computational models to identify potential HEA compositions for PFCs and their expected properties, conduct manufacturing process parameter development, and perform microstructural characterization and mechanical testing on the coatings for properties data. HEAs are expected to lead to breakthrough advances and superior performance in a wide array of applications across the aerospace, defense, automotive, energy, medical device, and electronics sectors, among others. Their value often lies in the potential to offer a suite of material properties tailored to a specific application rather than superior material performance according to only a single metric. For example, a high entropy steel alloy could simultaneously provide both high elongation to fracture and high ultimate tensile strength, a highly sought combination of properties for many industries including automotive and aerospace. High entropy alloys also excel in maintaining mechanical properties at both very high and very low temperatures; providing exceptional strength per weight, toughness, hardness, and corrosion resistance; and realizing challenging functional characteristics, such as magnetic, caloric, and electronic properties."

The new burn-in process will be rooted in extensive statistical experimental data to be collected in Phase I and Phase II of this program. This will allow us to extract all the critical empirical parameters required for mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) projections for high power MWIR and LWIR devices subjected to different operational conditions. The collected statistical burn-in data will be subsequently analyzed against material quality data collected for devices with different run time. Finally, a slow degradation model reconciling the experimental laser performance and material quality data will be developed. The model will be used to determine optimal accelerated burn-in parameters for weeding out defected QCLs with poor projected short-term reliability, to project MTTF for \u201cgood\u201d lasers under specific operational conditions, and to guide us in the development of high power devices with improved long term reliability."

This, in turn, will allow us to develop improved QCL fabrication recipes increasing damage threshold and, therefore, increasing optical power for state-of-the-art BH QCLs.

        "Abstract": "This will be accomplished using SSB\u2019s CSPE lithium battery that has 15% higher power density, is smaller, and has a 20% weight reduction over other lithium batteries that use a liquid electrolyte. CSPE performance remains stable in extreme conditions of 0% to 100% humidity and temperature from -40o C to 100o C. There are several areas that could be evaluated. In the case of small, hand- launched drones, the goal would be to design CSPE batteries that provide more power available to function and the ability to fly longer. Batteries for Silent vehicles would be able to travel faster and further. Other gear such as radios and laser-based instruments\u2019 operations would also be enhanced. Performance is also enhanced by the fact that SSB\u2019s CSPE lithium battery can be constructed to form fit any piece of equipment without compromising performance. Instead of a piece of Special Operations (SO) gear being built to accommodate the battery, the battery can be built to accommodate the gear. SSB\u2019s CSPE lithium batteries, safety and reliability will also be profoundly enhanced. SSB\u2019s CSPE lithium batteries eliminate the production of flammable gases, thus eliminating fire and explosion hazards. This is especially important in an operational environment where batteries are exposed to live fire, shrapnel, and being struck on rocks or other hard objects. SSB\u2019s CSPE construction of lithium batteries significantly minimizes the formation of dendrites that often cause conventional liquid electrolyte batteries to short out and fail after repeated charging and discharging cycles. As ions are exchanged between the anode and cathode over several charge and discharge cycles, a growth branches out that can cause the battery to fail or catch fire. Dendrites were found in the batteries related to the Boeing 787 battery fires that happened in 2014. SSB would work with units of AFSOC to apply its CSPE lithium battery design to enhance the performance, reliability, and versatility of AFSOC equipment that relies upon battery power. These specially designed batteries would be manufactured in the U.S. Manufacturing of SSB\u2019s CSPE lithium battery is both faster and cleaner, making it less expensive and eco-friendly. Being manufactured in the U.S. removes dependency on foreign manufacturers. SSB will also leverage this Phase I SBIR to apply our designer polymer electrolytes in Li-S batteries for higher energy density in Phase II execution. The use of a solid polymer electrolyte will restrain the polysulfide shuttle process, improve the cycling lifetime, and allow for manufacturing of a more advanced CSPE lithium battery. SSB\u2019s focus on polymer electrolytes is driven in part by the experience that our key personnel have with low-cost manufacturing of polymer materials. SSB is confident that only CSPE polymers can achieve high energy density, thereby yielding a significant cost advantage to its federal and commercial customers."

        "Abstract": "Laser communications (lasercom), also referred to as optical communications, provides the capability to meet the growing needs of US Military applications requiring high bandwidth, high-availability, low-latency, survivable, and secure links. Better than gigabit (Gb) per second data rates are achievable by laser communication, and are suitable for voice over IP (VoIP), streaming data, streaming high- definition video, and large file transfer. A high level of security is achieved through low probability of detection (LPD) and low probability of intercept (LPI) inherent to laser transmissions. In addition, optical communication is unaffected by radio frequency (RF) interference, and not subject to government spectrum licensing requirements. Small, compact laser terminals allow for system integration into ground vehicles, aircraft, and spacecraft. Vision Engineering Solutions (Vision) proposes to deliver two Optical Ground Stations (OGS) to NIWC, as part of this Direct to Phase II SBIR program to support laser communication. \u00a0One OGS will be part of a fixed site, and the other will be a transportable design.\u00a0 Both systems will be capable of day and night operations, communicating with satellites across Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geostationary Orbit (GEO), and compensating for atmospheric turbulence. The top-level component of each OGS are the Pointing and Tracking System and the Optical Platform. These components will be controlled from a common rack mount computer system, designated the Sensor Control Computer.\u00a0 Vision\u2019s development approach takes into account technical, schedule, and cost risks. As government and commercial operators increasingly seek to use laser communication in space systems, low cost Optical Ground Stations will be enabling elements of the overall communications architecture. Low cost and interoperability of the terminals will reduce the capital expenses associated with establishment of a geographically dispersed network necessary to serve a range of satellite orbits and assure access in the event of cloud cover or other weather. This SBIR will result in a final design for a ground terminal that meets the Government\u2019s stated performance requirements and is suitable for integration in existing or future global ground station networks. As the next step toward an operational capability, performance of the OGSs will be demonstrated with a government satellite."

        "Abstract": "Exascale computing for Large-Scale Numerical Simulation requires a new technology for optical communication. VCSEL based transmitters run out of bandwidth at 56 Gbps PAM4, and the latency of PAM4 is incompatible with exascale computing. Other available technologies arenbsp;expensive, have high power consumption, are far from proven or they require PAM4 andnbsp;temperature control.

The proposed device can operate over a wide temperature range, at least 20C to 100C and potentially over the full military range (-55C to 125C) without temperature control. The characteristic which distinguish our devicenbsp;from traditional Laser-EAM solutions is the extremely short, high absorption, low capacitance EAM which allows significantly higher data rates,nbsp;lower power andnbsp;operationnbsp;over large temperature ranges so TE coolers are not needed. The SE Laser-EAM has a 50% (0.3 pJ\/bit vs 0.6 pJ\/bit) reduction in power per bit compared to VCSEL solutions. The proposed low cost device can be manufactured by the billions. The SE Laser-EAM array can be flip-chip mounted onto silicon. This unique device has ten times the reach of VCSELs, more than sufficient for any data center or exascale computer. nbsp;Further, our proposed device has the inherent capability for 300 Gbps NRZ (600 Gbps PAM4) when packaging and IC driver technologies are available.nbsp;nbsp;\ntimes;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;"

        "Abstract": "The XFEL facility at SLAC is currently undergoing a major upgrade, where the soft X-ray repetition rate for LCLS II will be increase by almost 10,000 times, from 120 Hz to 1 MHz. The resulting high average power leads to new challenges for the survivability of beamline instrumentation, especially the sensors designed and implemented for quantitative assessment of the fundamental focal properties of the laser, for aligning X-ray instruments, and for conducting scientific experimental analysis. One of the critical components of the instrumentation is a scintillator which is vulnerable to thermal damage. RMD will address this challenge by innovatively integrating scintillator into material of high thermal conductivity in order to dissipate the intense localized heat. Two candidate materials will be evaluated for improving heat dissipation, both of which have the excellent bulk thermal conductivities. The scintillator will be grown as a transparent material using highly economic process. The proposed scintillator will be tailored to achieve high brightness and high spatial resolution while providing excellent X-ray absorption over a wide X-ray energy range. The proposed approach has numerous unique advantages and will effectively address specific needs of LCLS II. The goal of the proposed Phase I is to demonstrate feasibility of our concept. Specifically, in the Phase I, RMD Inc. will use special methods to grow scintillators and characterize their performance. Finite Element Analysis of the scintillator will be conducted to arrive at the design that can provide the desired thermal conductivity performance without degrading the spatial resolution or the response uniformity. The properties of the scintillator will be thoroughly characterized at RMD Inc. with X-rays, and then the feasibility will be tested at the XFEL beamline. Thus, successful development of the proposed scintillator will enable new avenues of research using LCLS II that benefit the public. For instance, in the development of new drugs (including COVID-19 related work), materials, and systems, all of which directly impact health care, our quality of life, and the widening of the US technology base. This work will also lead to advancements of technologies with significant commercial impact and will help maintain our nation\u2019s technological edge over competing nations."

        "Abstract": "The Basic Energy Sciences Report on Facility Upgrades has identified The Linear Coherent Light Source- II \u201cupgrade\u201d at Stanford Linear Accelerator as \u201cabsolutely central to contribute to world-leading science\u201d. This Light Source upgrade will provide X-ray energies up to 20 keV necessary to study fundamental atomic structure dynamics, electronic and nuclear coupling in biological and chemical processes. But to realize this upgrade there is a need to improve the reliability and the performance of the photocathode where the electrons are photoemitted in the accelerator. The currently-grown photocathodes at the Light Source are inadequate to meet the desired upgrade requirements. RMD will address the Light Source upgrade needs for the Stanford Linear Accelerator by reliable manufacturing of cathodes via sputtering technique and packaging them under vacuum for shipment to Stanford. Because the sputter-grown cathodes have a better performance and more robust compared to the conventional cathodes, they will facilitate the necessary upgrade. These cathodes will be protected by graphene top-layers that will extend the cathode lifetime in the accelerator. Also, sputtering allows mass production and thus stockpiling of cathodes, which the Linear Accelerator could purchase and introduce the same into their photo guns in a reliable fashion, when necessary. During Phase I, RMD was able to demonstrate the growth of bialkali antimonide photocathodes by sputtering technique, where multiple cathodes were demonstrated with similar performance specifications. The sputtered cathodes have exceptional surface smoothness and high-efficiency in green wavelength which will facilitate the desired beam brightness. A compatible vacuum packaging for the cathode was also independently demonstrated, which was unsealed at the Cornell beamline successfully in order to produce an electron beam. During the Phase II effort, the various unit operations demonstrated in Phase I will be integrated together to usher the manufacturing process for advanced photocathodes designed for Stanford Linear Accelerator energy upgrade. This effort will entail construction of a Photocathode Manufacturing Tool and optimizing the processes to produce high-efficiency and long-lifetime photocathodes. In a parallel effort, RMD will incorporate monolayer graphene to protect the cathode surface to improve the overall performance. RMD will develop technologies to package the cathode and unpack the same in order to deliver the same into a photo-gun at the Linear Accelerator. The availability of packaged cathodes will streamline the supply for accelerators at various national labs, small industries and Universities. The proposed technology will enable manufacturing of photocathodes for accelerators in the United States. The technology will also enable the realization of cost-competitive new detectors such as the Large Area Picosecond Photo Detectors. Availability of such detectors will impact medical investigations for cancer detection, border security screening, scattering neutron detectors for spallation sources to perform basic sciences, and deep underground neutrino experiments."

        "Abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a rapid, Pulsed Near-Infrared Photoluminescence (P-NIR-PL) and Stimulated Luminescence (SL) technique with micron spatial resolution, as a state-of-the art photoluminescence dating method for inorganic sediments, with substantially improved precision, accuracy, and turn-around time for sample processing. Picosecond-NIR-PL is a next-generation analytical platform for inorganic sediments. The team seeks to capture geochronological data from ~1 to 200,000 years prior. The approach addresses challenges with sample processing through the rapid detection of overlapping PL signals that will be deconvoluted and correlated to age. If successful, this project will provide new capabilities to geologists and archaeologists working on new geochronological methods for dating volcanic soils, charred materials, and sand\/rock materials from future extraterrestrial sites. A sizable niche market and strong commercialization opportunity exists if optical dating measurements can be performed rapidly and non-destructively, repeatedly with differentiation on the sub single-grain level, and reliably with minimal sample pre-treatment. The intellectual merit of this project focuses on instrument development to address the immediate demand for an accurate tool for differentiation of quartz and feldspar detection in sediments using an advanced spatial and time-resolved microscopy method with an attached dosing\/dating capability for geochronological dating. Separation of PL and SL decays that are previously unexplained will establish a novel geochronological method achieved by expanding the detection into the near-infrared. A picosecond pulsed laser source with picosecond-to-second resolution in kinetic decay will be combined with high spatial resolution to cover a wide range of excitation\/emission profiles that uniquely shorten the time required for a single measurement, from 13 hours to 20 minutes. Specifically, the combined time-resolved and spatially-resolved components create a powerful technique to distinguish molecular and crystalline environments as well as to distinguishing emissions from similar spectra and unique elemental microstructures. The proposed activities may advance engineering and science innovation in pulsed optical\/NIR dating methods with a focus on high performance, commercial instrument development for rapid sample screening. Establishment of both the state-of-the-art instrumentation and analytical testing service for optical dating will be performed by a new diversified customer segment with implementation of an online geochronological library. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Then when luck comes you are ready.\u201d\nThere is no room for luck when conducting hydrographic surveying in Arctic coastal waters.\nSatellites can play a key role in operational efficiency, cost effective use of existing technology and\nrisk reduction. More precise and extensible satellite-based technologies, when leveraged to inform\nhydrographic surveying operations, allow operators to be more exact in their operations.\nTo fully exploit the precision of Earth observation multispectral satellites for marine applications and\nspecifically for Arctic conditions of short collection timeframes, challenging weather conditions and\nhighly dynamic coastal areas, imagery collection must be exact and optimized to the nuances and\nunknowns inherent to the region. This research will integrate space-based multispectral, laser and\nradar sensors in a multi-sensor approach, using one sensor to inform the collection scheme for\nanother, to be exacting and precise when deploying these assets. This research fuses multiple\nexisting space-based technologies and new applications for future satellite constellations through\ncross-platform systems integration and near real-time interoperability with hydrographic survey\noperations and routines."

        "Abstract": "Characterizing the chemical components of additive manufacturing feedstock powders determines the final parts\u2019 material properties and performance. Currently, feedstock chemical characterization involves multiple analytical techniques and industry standards. Although traditional spectrometry measures both the material\u2019s major and residual constituents, it requires a highly trained analytical chemist to execute proper sample preparation procedures, signal interference corrections, and calibration. Furthermore, these instruments fail to measure light elements (i.e., elements with atomic numbers lower than 11). Thus, quantifying low-mass elements requires additional methods, inert gas fusion and combustion. \nAddressing many challenges of other techniques, Exum developed the first Laser Ablation Laser Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (LALI-TOF-MS). It combines an innovative dual laser ionization source with a Time-of-Flight mass analyzer for high-sensitivity, high-throughput chemical characterization. As a result, it can measure major metallic elements, residual elements, and low-mass elements in a single analytical session. Plus, it directly analyzes any solid sample, which significantly reduces the sample preparation requirements of other techniques. Thus far, Exum\u2019s beta version has shown technically promising results, however, the team has identified key challenges to commercialization. To meet the additive manufacturing industry\u2019s needs, this Phase I work involves both hardware and software enhancements to Exum\u2019s betaversion instrument."

        "Abstract": "ColdQuanta, Inc. in collaboration with its partner Vescent Photonics, LLC will build a Rack-Integrated, Mountable Rubidium Optical Clock (RIMROC) to serve as a portable, ultra-stable frequency reference. RIMROC leverages the industry-leading capability of both organizations in quantum atomic technology and integrated laser systems to form a frequency reference that brings both precision timing and environmental robustness into a single platform. The design builds upon previous efforts in optical clocks performed at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the NIST Atomic Devices and Instrumentation Group (NIST-ADI) that utilized a two-photon transition in warm vapor 87Rb. The approach is elegant in its simplicity but requires careful engineering to realize its full capability \u2013 the potential for frequency instabilities of &lt; 1 \u00d7 10-13\/ t 1\/2 at small t and flicker floors of 1 \u00d7 10-15 at several days. ColdQuanta and Vescent Photonics are uniquely positioned to provide this level of performance in a compact form-factor given their nearly 40 years of combined quantum technology development. RIMROC will integrate Vescent\u2019s industry-leading optical frequency comb hardware with ColdQuanta\u2019s flight-qualified optomechanical technology into a 3U enclosure measuring less than 30 L. In their Phase II work, ColdQuanta and Vescent Photonics will develop two clock systems: The first, performed under the Base period, will bring together the key subsystems to demonstrate a two-photon optical clock on the bench and measure effects related to vibration-induced noise. The second, developed under the Option work, will be a packaging of the benchtop system into an integrated, single enclosure that is performance validated and delivered to the government. With the successful construction and delivery of the RIMROC prototype a monumental step will be taken towards advancing the United States capabilities in \u201call-things\u201d timing as they relate to assured PNT, telecommunications, reconnaissance, and scientific research."

        "Abstract": "Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is utilizing associated particle imaging (API) D-T neutron generators to image thick objects using portable equipment. Starfire Industries and Adelphi Technology have both worked with the DOE via the SBIR contracting mechanism to develop these portable, high-flux API D-T neutron generators. They feature a scintillator mechanically affixed to the inside of a viewport and a custom readout on the other side of the viewport to make sense of the scintillation light from each alpha event. The accelerator part of the neutron generator is at high vacuum, so the viewport is part of the vacuum boundary.Previous designs used the Thermo Fisher Scientific API-120 equipped with a Schott 75C-6 fiber-optic faceplate. Schott hermetically sealed the 75C-6 to a flange and then Thermo laser welded the assembly into the accelerator tube. The fabrication process, from creating the faceplate assembly to installing it into a neutron generator and then baking it out to remove contaminates had an unacceptably high failure rate. Simple monolithic glass viewports or flange mounted viewports could be a workable solution, but the latter are relatively heavy and ORNL has a strong preference to permanently install (welded) fiber-optic faceplate assemblies instead. This proposal addresses that need by seeking to develop a robust process for reliably fabricating fiber-optic faceplate assemblies with the required size, optical properties, and final assembly\/welding\/bakeout tolerance. The Phase I work will focus primarily on developing the glass-to-metal joint for the fiber-optic faceplate assemblies. Depending on the materials of construction and physical arrangement, our baseline approach will be to use a vitreous glass solder in combination with a compliant metal layer to accommodate differential thermal expansion. If the metal component of the fiber-optic faceplate assembly can be made of an alloy with a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and compatible metallurgy, we may investigate a joint in which the glass component is bonded directly to the metal component. Our goal will be to fabricate full-scale prototype fiber-optic faceplate assemblies by the end of Phase I that can be trial fit to the Starfire Industries and Adelphi Technology portable high-flux API D-T neutron generators."

        "Abstract": "The development of high average-power lasers is fundamentally challenged by the onset of thermally induced birefringence in typical gain media. This depolarization caused by birefringence is spatially dependent and difficult to correct. The result is a significant loss of energy and beam uniformity. The best-known solutions for this problem involve paired numbers of passes through identically stressed gain media with some means of rotating the beam polarization 90-degrees, wholesale. The subsequent pass will then undo the effects of the prior pass with varying degrees of success. This is not always feasible given the cost and complexity of adding amplifier stages and\/or the costs (or even existence) of the optics required to rotate the polarization. Other solutions include changing the gain configuration so that the thermal stresses are along the axis of the gain instead of radially. This translates to not using cylindrical rod amplifiers and forgoing the many design and efficiency benefits associated with rods. The novel solution proposed here is the implementation of a phase retarder plate which uses a custom fabricated metasurface to control the polarization, as a countermeasure to the birefringence in common gain media. The metasurface retarder plate has the appearance and dimensions of a typical, laser-grade window. The Phase I effort will evaluate the plate\u2019s tolerance to high laser fluences and high average- powers. To be practical, the plate should have a damage threshold that is above 5 J\/cm2 for a 10-ns, near- infrared, laser pulse, and it should have negligible absorption. The theoretical transmission of the proposed plate is better than 97%. Should the project continue to Phase II, the program will demonstrate efficacy in a high average-power, high peak-power, laser amplifier which uses the metasurface phase retarder plate to mitigate birefringence. The successful demonstration of the technology proposed under this Funding Opportunity work will enable the drastic reduction in size, complexity, and cost of high average-power lasers. A broad range of potential applications for such lasers exist, including hadron therapy, isotope production, and inertial fusion energy."

        "Abstract": "Most superconducting accelerator magnets are presently based on a conventional \u201ccosine theta\u201d design. Typically, the magnet length vastly exceeds the aperture, and the loss in effective length from the ends (about a coil diameter in typical dipoles) is relatively small. However, for relatively short magnets such as those envisioned for the Interaction Region (IR) of the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) the end effects of the conventional design will result in a large relative reduction of the integrated field. To reduce the cost of EIC IR magnets, use of \u201cdirect wind technology\u201d is being considered. Though the \u201cdirect wind technology\u201d has been used in several low field magnets, it is yet to be demonstrated for a combination of high fields and large aperture magnets, such as those required in the EIC. A loss in magnetic length from the conventional ends increases the requirement of the field in the body of the magnet and hence the cost and technical risk of the magnet program. We propose to develop and demonstrate a medium field \u201cdirect wind\u201d dipole with an \u201coptimum integral design\u201d approach that promises to have essentially no loss in effective length due to the ends. In the \u201coptimum integral design\u201d approach, the ends become an integral part of the magnet body - creating an effective azimuthal integral cosine theta distribution of the current density. This proposal will examine the \u201coptimum integral design\u201d for the ~3.3 T B0APF EIC IR dipole, which has a coil i.d. of 120 mm and a coil length of about 600 mm. In this case the estimated savings in effective length, about one diameter, is about 20%. During Phase I, a preliminary engineering design of the medium field EIC IR dipole B0APF with \u201coptimum integral design\u201d will be developed. This will include magnetic and mechanical analysis and a support structure likely consisting of stainless-steel tubes. Phase I will also demonstrate a short length (~150 mm), intermediate field (~2 T) proof-of-principle dipole with an aperture which will be close to the B0APF contemporaneous specifications. During Phase II, a proof-of-principle, full field dipole will be built and tested. The optimum integral design makes very short length superconducting dipole, quadrupole and other higher order multipole magnets possible that are not possible by other designs. This opens up new possibilities in the fields of accelerator, medical, defense and other applications. Demonstration of the \u201coptimum integral design\u201d with \u201cdirect wind technology\u201d for short medium field superconducting magnets essentially eliminates the cost of expensive tooling such as needed for typical each conventional cosine theta magnets."

A precision guided munition with such a seeker would combine the functionality and capability of three system-level apertures into one device where sensing, processing, and algorithms can be much more tightly coupled to provide a higher level of actionable information to the warfighter. Furthermore, a single sensor solution would be able to seamlessly transition from one guidance mode (i.e. image?based) to SAL in order to disambiguate high?clutter targets. One can also consider CONOPS where sophisticated image processing algorithms could be operating with the Vis-SWIR imagery to conduct long?range navigation in GPS?denied environments and then actually engage with the target using traditional SAL, all within the same sensor space claim."

Common electro?optical seeker modalities include semi?active laser (SAL) or image?based in either the visible or infrared bands and dual model systems combining these modalities do so by use multiple sensors thus at added cost, size and power, but usually not both modalities. Attollo\u2019s approach of combining high definition shortwave infrared (SWIR) passive imaging with a more sensitive SAL pulsed laser sensing into a single sensor element is a natural progression for next?generation dual?mode seeker sensors that has a number of benefits over traditional quad cell?based seekers and the use of discreet sensors to achieve the dual mode capability"

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThe overall goal of this STTR project is to commercialize a novel optical eye scanner device capable of\nmeasuring the biomechanical properties of tissues via Brillouin light scattering. The Brillouin technology\ninvented in the co-PI\u2019s lab has shown broad potential for improving the diagnosis and treatment of vision\ndisorders. Clinical data obtained with current laboratory systems revealed corneal stiffness changes\ncaused by keratoconus, collagen crosslinking and keratectomy. For commercialization of this promising\ntechnology, this fast-track project streamlines development through innovative engineering that focuses\non miniaturization, cost lowering and manufacturing compatibility, in close collaboration between the\ninventor\u2019s lab and a spin-off startup that is led by an experienced team in the ophthalmology device\nindustry. Phase-I was previously funded to develop a frequency-stabilized laser source with reduced\nspontaneous emission noise (successfully completed). Phase-II will take this innovation to develop and\ntest a tabletop alpha prototype (Aim II-1) and then build portable beta prototypes (Aim II-2). The\nfunctionality, reliability and operability of the prototypes will be validated in clinical pilot trials in an eye\nhospital for variety of clinical cases including keratoconus cases, pre- and post- refractive surgery cases,\nand pre- and post- collagen crosslinking cases. The successful completion of this project will have\ntransferred Brillouin microscopy from academia to the medical device industry, and will accelerate the\ntranslation of tissue biomechanical assessments into clinical practice. Ultimately, the successful\ncommercialization of in vivo Brillouin imaging will have a high impact on eye healthcare by improving the\ndiagnosis, intervention and surgical treatment of various vision problems.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE\nThis proposal is relevant to public health because it will accelerate the commercialization of novel\ndiagnostic devices to identify progressive keratoconus and risk of post-LASIK ectasia more accurately\nthan currently possible and allow patients to receive timely optimized treatments. Unlike current methods\nfor detection of keratoconus, the proposed technique will directly measure biomechanical properties of\ncorneal stroma before the disease manifests itself via corneal shape distortion. Furthermore, the new\ninstrument will improve the outcome of collagen crosslinking and astigmatic keratotomy and may help\ndevelopment of interventional prevention of myopia and cataract. Having spatially-resolved\nbiomechanical measurements of the cornea may allow customization for treatment options designed to\nstrengthen the tissue. Therefore, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH\u2019s mission of fostering\ninnovative research strategies to increase the nation\u2019s ability to improve the treatment of disease."

        "Abstract": "The Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Division (EESSD) of DOE\u2019s Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) aims to better predict the Earth system on seasonal to multidecadal time scales to inform domestic policy. As part of this mission, one of EESSD\u2019s grand challenges is to explore the drivers and responses in the Earth system. In response to this challenge, DOE is researching clouds and their impact on the global climate. In order to understand cloud growth, dynamics, and the impact of warming, researchers need to make very rapid, in situ measurements of water vapor concentration and temperature in the supersaturated regions in clouds. In this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program, Nikira Labs Inc. proposes to develop, deploy, and deliver multiple compact, lightweight analyzers for very rapid, in-situ monitoring of water vapor concentration ([H2O]) and air temperature (T) aboard airborne platforms. The analyzers will use multipass tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy to make real-time, first-principles measurements of both parameters at the millisecond timescale with no memory effects. The resulting systems will be utilized by the Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research facility to study supersaturation and better understand cloud dynamics. In Phase I, Nikira Labs Inc. will select a measurement strategy based on spectral modeling and fabricate a small (25 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm), lightweight (&lt; 5 kg) prototype unit capable of accurately and rapidly (100 Hz) measuring [H2O] and T over the ranges expected for 0 \u2013 5000 meters altitude. The instrument will be extensively laboratory tested to determine its accuracy, precision, linearity, dynamic range, time response, and immunity to vibration and pressure changes. Subsequent to this testing, Nikira Labs will deploy the sensor for both terrestrial and airborne sensing in benign and foggy environments. Finally, the Phase I results will be used to design a series of Phase II instruments suitable for integration into a variety of DOE unmanned aerial systems (UASs), including the ArcticShark and tethered balloons. In addition to its value in studying climate change feedbacks, the SBIR instrument can readily be reconfigured to measure sticky and reactive gases like ammonia for environmental and semiconductor applications. As discussed in detail in the Phase I Commercialization Plan, Nikira Labs Inc. anticipates a cumulative sales revenue of $44.6M during the first 10 years of commercialization for these two markets alone."

        "Abstract": "In this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) effort, Nikira Labs Inc. proposes to utilize open-path, mid-infrared cavity enhanced absorption spectrometry to develop a sensitive (&lt; 10 ppt), fast (&lt; 100 seconds), and highly-selective ethylene oxide (EtO) analyzer suitable for field-deployment. The US EPA has concluded that EtO, which is widely used in ethylene glycol production and medical sterilization, is carcinogenic to humans and assigned it a total inhalation unit risk of 3.3 \u0081~ 10-3 \u0192\u00cag\/m3 (~12 ppt). At current levels of control, the carcinogenic risk of EtO is too high, and new amendments to the 2003Miscellaneous Organic Chemical Manufacturing National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) will most likely require significantly improved EtO monitoring. Current monitoring techniques (e.g. EPA Method TO-15) only provide infrequent, single measurements (grab samples) and may be confounded by interfering compounds including trans-2-butene and acetaldehyde. In this Phase I, Nikira Labs Inc. will fabricate a mid-infrared cavity-enhanced absorption system that consists of a quantum cascade laser coupled into a high-finesse optical cavity in an incoherent fashion. By using a novel cavity geometry and coupling methodology, the system noise can be significantly reduced. Moreover, by using an open-path cavity, there are no \u0081gwetted\u0081h materials and no sample handling losses. Subsequent to the prototype development, the analyzer will be extensively laboratory tested on EtO standards to empirically determine its analytical performance (accuracy, linearity, precision, time response\u0081c). Potential cross interferences will be measured, and a trial field-deployment will be used to identify Phase II improvements. In addition to its utility for next-generation environmental monitoring, a sensitive, real-time EtO analyzer also has commercial utility in the medical sterilization and petrochemical markets. A preliminary analysis of these markets suggests that Nikira Labs Inc. can realize a 5-year revenue exceeding $7.8M for these two applications alone."

Millions of\nbiochemical or cell-based assays are conducted to test the activity of small molecules, antibodies\nand oWher compoXndV Wo idenWif\\ \u00b3hiWV\u00b4 or drXg candidaWeV for fXrWher study, including pre-clinical\nand clinical studies. However, the most used technologies for high-throughput screening, such as\nHTRF, Alpha and ELISA, can only measure one or two parameters per sample, providing\nincompleWe informaWion of Whe drXg\u00b6V biological mechanisms. Furthermore, these technologies\ndetect analytes or activity outside the cell, which can result in misleading hits as compounds may\nfail to achieve the same effect in cell samples. To accelerate drug discovery, there is a major need\nfor multiplexed screening at high throughput. The long-term goal of this application is to develop\nhigh-throughput flow cytometry to enable multiplexed drug screening. Although flow cytometry\ncan measure up to 30 parameters per sample at single-cell resolution, its throughput has thus far\nbeen severely limited by its slow sampling speed. The short-term goal of Phase I is developing\nnovel laser particle (LP) probes to barcode and pool cell samples to improve throughput, and\ndemonstrate feasibility using a custom-built flow cytometer. This approach can eliminate sampling\ndead time, reducing acquisition time from 1 hour per 384-well plate to a few minutes. Furthermore,\nsample barcoding reduces reagent consumption and increases statistical robustness as samples\nare processed and stained together after pooling. Completion of Phase I research will establish\nthe feasibility of high-throughput flow cytometry using LP barcodes. Development of this\ntechnology will greatly benefit the drug discovery industry by saving time and cost.Project Narrative\nFinding drug candidates commonly involves high-speed screening of millions of compounds on\ncell samples. Current screening technologies read only one or two parameters per sample, often\ninsufficient to understand drug effects accurately. This project develops novel barcodes to enable\nmore comprehensive screening and thereby contributing to faster drug discovery."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nQuantifying the presence, function, and fate of different immune cells is crucial in immunology\nresearch and development of immunotherapies. Flow cytometry is a single-cell technique that is\nwidely used to measure different protein markers expressed by immune cells at high throughput.\nHowever, spectral overlap between fluorophore labels makes measurement of more than 20\nmarkers difficult, often requiring months of optimization, and limits the maximum number of\nmarkers measured to around 40. These limitations prevent more comprehensive characterization\nof immune cells that is critically needed for immunology and immune-oncology research. Mass\ncytometry and RNA-seq based methods are throughput-limited and cost-prohibitive for measuring\npatient blood samples containing millions of cells. The goal of this SBIR application is to develop\ncyclic flow cytometry, a high-throughput, affordable and easy-to-use solution for the high-marker\nsingle-cell analysis market. Cyclic flow cytometry leverages proprietary laser particle technology\nto barcode individual cells for repeated flow measurements, enabling complex flow cytometry\nexperiments with 30 or more markers to be broken down into multiple, much easier cycles with\naround 10 markers at a time. The feasibility of this innovative approach has been verified in the\nPhase I research. The specific aims of this Phase II research involve developing and testing a\ncomplete workflow and fully functional prototype for cyclic flow cytometry. The system will be\nvalidated with external investigators for several applications. Completion of the Phase II work will\nlead to early market validation of cyclic flow cytometry and directly lead to design of product-ready\nprototypes, followed by commercial launch."

        "Abstract": "Additive manufacturing technology enables field production of spare parts, building non-traditional shapes and sizes, a reduction in the required number of individual parts, and expedited production, all offering great potential to the DOD. However, such parts can suffer from a combination of defect types and inherent problems, specific to AM that are difficult to detect in the finished part with conventional inspection methods. Such defects change the mechanical properties of the material and affect performance of a part. This SBIR Phase I proposal is to develop and demonstrate a method to evaluate printed parts and to enable certification of subsequent similar printed parts without employing current destructive, expensive, and time-consuming methods. Every object is a unique vibrational system that can be categorized by its vibrational spectrum. It is virtually impossible for two objects that are not identical to have the same vibrational spectrum; therefore, this spectrum provides a unique signature that matches and identifies specific components free of many types of defects. Vibrational properties of components, such as resonant modes, damping, and spectral frequency depend strongly upon the mechanical properties of the material, including its internal hardness, tensile strength, alloy\/composite compositions, flaws, defects, and other internal material properties, and they respond differently to various forcing functions. In previous research we have demonstrated how such defects and printing errors affect the vibrational spectrum of AM parts, how the spectrum can be employed as a signature that is altered in a detectable manner, and how to measure and correlate such signatures with AM anomalies. The concept leads to a non- destructive testing method that can detect relevant defects in 3D printed metal parts and provide information for an assortment of representative part designs that can be correlated statistically with tests-to-failure. In this research we will print a large number of metal test coupons with and without known defects, measure their acoustical signatures with laser Doppler vibrometry, and determine if deviations from the predicted signature and parts known to be without defects can be correlated with the known defects and correlate these with tests to failure. The proposal includes a plan to develop and demonstrate methods of both predicting and measuring the effects of typical manufacturing defects on the acoustical signatures of AM parts This can lead to a relatively simple procedure to anticipate critical problems in AM parts without employing complex and expensive NDE or destructive testing methods.

        "Abstract": "Radiation detectors are broadly useful for nuclear nonproliferation as well as many scientific, medical, and defense applications. One element of these detectors is often a microchannel plate, which can amplify signals by a factor of a million, allowing single particles to be detected with normal electronics. Microchannel plates are currently made by an expensive and laborious process. We have pioneered creating these structures by using a commercial 3d printer with very high resolution. Unfortunately, the design of this printer makes it very slow. A dimesized device takes over 50 hours to print. This has been adequate for exploring the technique, but is much too slow for creating detectors of useful size for example 12x12cm, the size of a compact disc case. We have a design for a new 3d printer that will be much faster. In phase I of this work, design and testing of key components were done, and we proved the principle of threshold writing \u2013 which is akin to drawing a thin line with the thick marker. This means that we can 3d print very fine objects very quickly. We will build and test a prototype and demonstrate that it can quickly print useful size microchannel plates for use in radiation detectors for national nuclear security applications. A new, patent applied for objective will be procured, along with custom lasers and a scanning system, and everything will be integrated into a working system. Smartphonesized test prints will be activated by materials scientists at Argonne, and tested by their high energy physicists. This technology could lead to a 3d printer that is directly useful for many applications. Any customers who want large, high precision and surface finish pieces in thermoplastic would find this interesting. For example, rapid prototyping shops would be customers for the printer. The radiation detector has many other uses, such as for homeland security, medical imaging, and analytical lab instruments."

        "Abstract": "In the Phase I of the project we studied feasibility of utilizing unique capabilities of diffractive waveplates \u2013 the new, fourth generation of optics \u00a0\u2013 for development of thin, flat and compact, window-mountable and light-weight, high-efficiency and high pointing accuracy, fast systems with millisecond re-pointing capability\u00a0for high energy beam delivery for submarines. Several device architectures have been identified for conventional and novel emerging threats such as hypersonic missiles and swarms of boats and drones. Gimbals and other conventional beam directors are not fast enough for directing the beam\u00a0and with random access to multiple fast moving targets,\u00a0are not scalable and\/or do not have high enough radiation damage thresholds. The objective of the Phase 2 of the proposal is to fabricate and test the most promising device architectures identified in the Phase 1 work that best meet technology requirements for submarines related to limitations in sizes and compatibility with operation in marine environments. Optimizing beam director architecture for maximizing beam diameter over the required field of regard (FOR) for a given beam director window size, fabricating, testing and delivering deployable prototype devices are the main objectives of the Phase 2 work along with the analysis of novel capabilities related with\u00a0sharing the high-energy laser aperture with a short-wave infrared (SWIR) or mid-wave infrared (MWIR) surveillance sensor. The risk that flat optics will be susceptible to damage by high energy laser\u00a0beams was mitigated in Phase I by demonstrating damage thresholds for CW radiation at 1.064 \u00b5m wavelength far higher than needed for use in multi-kilowatt class laser\u00a0beams systems. Additional laser damage testing will be performed during Phase I Option and Phase 2. Optical aperture diameter up to 6\u201d demonstrated during Phase I will be scaled to 8\u201d and up to 12\u201d diameter."

        "Abstract": "The objective of the proposed work is study of opportunities of laser hardening of submarine optical systems that include visible and variety of infrared cameras as well as sensors and optics incorporated in the high energy beam controller system. The phase 1 work and the Phase 1 Option will allow identifying laser hardening system requirements that are specific to submarines, including requirements to optical and nonlinear optical properties of the materials to be used in the system. The Phase 1 work and its Option would also allow to develop and analyze the main concepts for laser hardening which will be tested and prototyped in the Phase 2 of the project. 4G Optics is most promising to provide effective solutions to the problem of laser hardening, particularly, for submarine optical systems, due to the opportunity of performing any optical function (lens, prism, beam shaping, etc.), even combinations of optical functions, with micrometer thin transparent material layers. Thus, laser hardening systems can complement optical systems of photonics masts and high energy laser beam controllers of future submarines without major modifications to the present opto-mechanical layouts within the masts. Notably, 4G Optics allows controlling laser beams with practically 100% efficiency. By that, its properties are inherently different for light propagating in opposite directions. For example, the sign of the focal length of a 4G lens is positive or negative depending on which side of the lens is facing the beam. Finally, 4G optical components can be made using highly nonlinear optical materials enabling optically switching of 4G optical components and systems between diffractive and non-diffractive states. The main challenge of laser hardening technologies is to provide protection against all different wavelengths and types of laser beams, pulsed and cw, ensuring sufficiently fast reaction times, and high enough contrast in rejecting the threat laser beams.\u00a0 Additionally, this has to be accomplished without appreciably affecting the functions of the variety of optical sensors and systems. Additionally, when incorporating diffractive optics into a system, the challenge is overcoming dispersive and polarization effects which we expect to accomplish using combinations of 4G optical films that provide polarization-independent compensation of diffraction effects."

        "Abstract": "Serial sectioning of microelectronics, as needed for performing destructive, high-resolution reverse engineering and \u00a0\u00a0failure analysis, faces several challenges, due to the ever-growing miniaturization of features of interest. Some of these challenges are as follows: (1) Current methods of delayering require access to multiple pieces of mechanical equipment such as semi-automated polishing machine, semi-automated milling machine, laser, gel etch, computer numerical control (CNC) milling machine, and ion beam milling machine; (2) A streamlined workflow often does not exist and the quality of the process, to a great extent, depends on operator\u2019s skills; (3) Maintaining the planarity of the layers is a very challenging task using the current technology; (4) Relocating the sample between the delayering and imaging equipment puts the integrity of the sample at risk, gives rise to post-alignment and repeatability issues and significantly increases the time associated with the process; (5) Throughput of the current methods is low, if repeatability and reliability are of concern; (6) Material selectivity comes at a high cost, namely very low material removal rate; (7) Multiple samples may be needed for the reverse engineering process, with one sample for ach layer. However, this may be problematic as the layer thickness may be different within the set of used samples, due to the variations present during the manufacturing process. Our proposed solution, the feasibility of which will be investigated in phase I, is an all-in-one tool that can address the abovementioned challenges. This tool features femto-second pulsed laser, that enables athermal ablation, integrated with a polygon scanning system, that enables rapid, accurate and repeatable material removal, laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), that enables real-time elemental analysis and material selective removal, and machine learning (ML) algorithms for controlled, high-precision, high-throughput material ablation. The tool incorporates a co-axial-with-laser far working distance digital microscope for real-time monitoring of the ablation process while performing imaging up to 1000X magnification. Further, a transfer shuttle will be integrated for fast, high-precision, successive transfer of sample among the material ablation component and the high-resolution imaging components (e.g., scanning electron microscope (SEM)) without the need for breaking the environmental conditions of any of these compartments, also enabling correlative multi-modality inspection. In addition, an analysis module, that will leverage state-of-the-art image processing and analysis algorithms will be developed for automated decision making about the serial sectioning procedure. Finally, a user-interface\/visualization module will be added for seamless serial sectioning jobs that is flexible and customizable for different types of users."

        "Abstract": "Most infrared lasers emit light that is strongly polarized and require polarization-maintaining fibers to preserve the as-launched polarization state as it propagates through the fiber. While polarization maintaining fibers are commercially available in the visible, near infrared and short wavelength infrared, the silica glasses used for these fibers have extremely high optical loss in the mid infrared. For the spectral region 3-6 \u00b5m, other glasses such as telluride, fluoride, or sulfide must be used as a fiber material. Despite years of research, there are no commercially available polarization maintaining fibers for this spectral range. High performance single-mode polarization maintaining MIR fibers have been identified as a key enabling technology for next-generation Infrared Counter Measures and chemical and explosive detection. \u00a0The proposed single-mode polarization maintaining fiber addresses the mechanical and optical deficiencies of earlier designs by using an index guided solution.\u00a0 The microstructured index-guiding fiber design is compatible with fluoride, telluride, sulfide glasses and delivers birefringence &gt;10-3. The Phase I program demonstrated the feasibility of developing novel PM fiber by testing the simplified design. In Phase II the PM fiber matching the design with required birefringence will be manufactured and fully characterized."

The Advanced Marine Layer Characterization Source is a SWaP-efficient fiber laser capable of generating 10W of average power to study the marine layer and enable several new avenues of research by providing high power pulses in the Deep Ultraviolet (DUV), the visible, and the near-IR (NIR). The multi-wavelength measurement system will enable measurement and modeling of key elements of the near surface marine layer. The novel fiber laser system can also be a key performance enhancement to the Navy\u2019s expanding programs in High Energy Lasers.

        "Abstract": "In this program, Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) and Professor Eric. G. Johnson (Clemson University) will develop an integrated optical transceiver for underwater communication using orbital angular momentum (OAM) on a silicon-nitride photonics platform. A high-bandwidth underwater optical link is a critical need for underwater communications. An ideal underwater communications link should be compact and robust, capable of high bandwidths with low error-rates and crosstalk to establish a secure link over long distances. An optical communication system operating at visible wavelengths (having minimal water absorption) is an attractive solution as radio frequencies are unable to deeply penetrate water and acoustic systems are low-bandwidth. The large bandwidths and high directionality of laser-based systems are a promising alternative; however, Gaussian beam systems suffer from scattering due to turbidity, aberrations from turbulence, and other obstructions (e.g. bubbles). OAM modes have been shown to be more resilient to turbidity and turbulence than Gaussian beams, are also more secure, and can be spatially multiplexed for increased bandwidth. This effort will focus on developing an OAM transceiver head that can be incorporated into a optical communication link for multiplexing OAM states and transmitting them over distances &gt;150 m."

        "Abstract": "Physical Sciences Inc. will develop a compact, passive optical beam director for an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) that works cooperatively with a laser transmitter and spectral receiver co-mounted to a Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV). The system will detect ground contaminants 50 meters ahead of the NBCRV without driving through the hazard. The proposed architecture minimizes SWaP burden on the UAS, locates higher cost components off the UAS, reduces power draw on the UAS batteries, and does not require data transmission from the UAS to the NBCRV. Feasibility of the sensor architecture was demonstrated in the Phase I program through assembly of a breadboard system and testing against triethyl phosphate dosed on relevant surfaces in a laboratory. Experiments demonstrated the Phase I breadboard could detect 7.5 g\/m2 to 15 g\/m2 of TEP on all surfaces within 5ft. of simulated travel distance. Testing also demonstrated the ability to track a UAS with computer vison algorithms at a 50-meter standoff, using a microbolometer, to within an accuracy of 200\u00a0urad. The Phase II program will produce a fieldable brassboard system consisting of a transceiver, tracking and pointing systems for the ground vehicle and UAS, and a UAS optical beam director payload."

        "Abstract": "With the increasing demand on battlefield information transfer bandwidth, free space optical (FSO) links are emerging as a necessary alternative and\/or addition to existing RF and microwave systems. All platforms, from space to air to ground to the individual soldier, can benefit from the unique aspects of FSO links. In addition to higher bandwidth (in excess of 10 Gb\/s) FSO links also bring increased security because they are challenging to intercept and tap for eavesdropping. To date, most implementations exploit mature telecommunications-industry technology and operate at wavelengths around 1.5 microns. With recent advances in longwave-infrared (LWIR, 8\u201312 \u00b5m) source and detector technology, there is an opportunity to extend FSO communications to these longer wavelengths where reduced Rayleigh scattering lowers transmission losses. In this effort, Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) in partnership with Thor Quantum Electronics (TQE), will advance this field by developing and demonstrating a high bandwidth FSO communications link using novel high bandwidth LWIR quantum cascade lasers (QCLs)."

        "Abstract": "As the global race for faster and more efficient technology proliferates, it is imperative that the United States stay at the forefront of information processing, sensing, networking, communications, and security. The need is growing for complex technical problems to be solved more quickly, and for information to be processed and delivered more securely. The principles of quantum mechanics are considered critical to satisfying this demand. Problem Statement. Experimentation which enables the development and application of quantum technologies requires a complex suite of testbed equipment including lasers, ultra-high vacuums, an atomic source assembly, an ion pump, and direct current and radio frequency feedthrough connectors, among others. The level of precision, and the extreme specifications, make this some of the most complicated equipment to operate successfully. These systems currently source and trap ions via an atomic flux generated by ablation lasers however, other sources are under development, which will allow development across multiple species of interest. Currently, there is no open source software solution that facilitates calibration, characterization, and control of quantum processors. The lack of a turn-key solution results in lengthy, labor-intensive, error-prone quantum experimentation, and prevents development and expansion of the market. The object of Phase I is to conduct research and development that creates open source software and a user interface to support and enhance experimentation in quantum physics, through the calibration, characterization, and control of quantum lab hardware from state preparation and measurement through gate implementation and compilation. Phase I will conclude with a demonstration of prototype software meeting this objective with a select sample subset of quantum testbed equipment. Phase lI will broaden the scope and capabilities of the software to include additional hardware, interfaces, tools, and automation, to efficiently calibrate and control quantum processors. The software will benefit quantum development and experimentation, in support of research and development throughout the federal government, and into a vibrant and growing commercial market. Presently, there is no commercially available turn-key solution which proposes to be a complete control system with an elegant user interface for quantum information experiments. This makes the development of this capability essential to continue our leadership in this field, and our influence throughout global quantum development and implementation."

        "Abstract": "Semiconductor-based widely tunable lasers are attractive in that they are capable of wavelength switching on short timescales (lt;10ns); however, in order to switch at those speeds and remain stable, sophisticated control electronics and strategies are required.nbsp; The traditional approach to achieving switching speeds on the order of 100ns is to use an FPGA that interfaces to multiple digital to analog converters via a high-speed interface, resulting in a relatively large footprint and high power consumption (10s of watts not including the laser itself).nbsp; In our proposed approach, we suggest using our proprietary semiconductor devices that provide on-chip thermal compensation to remove the sensitivities to changing injection current, in conjunction with high-speed, low power consumption direct digital synthesis waveform generation integrated circuits.nbsp; This will result in a small footprint (approximately 2.7rdquo; x 3.4rdquo; x 0.54rdquo;) module that consumes less than 10W total (including laser and thermoelectric cooler).nbsp; This solution will enable volume and power constrained applications to adopt the capabilities that widely tunable laser source modules have to offer.nbsp; These applications include lidar (employing wavelength sensitive beam steering elements and\/or FMCW), atmospheric gas sensing (methane, etc.), and fiber sensing."

        "Abstract": "The diverse workload of ever-increasing cloud and high- performance computing applications brings many challenges to traditional server-centric computing system architectures with a fixed amount of compute, memory and storage nodes. Conventional electrical interconnect approach suffers from the incapability of disaggregating the storage from the compute over few meters due to the inherent losses associated with transmitting the high bandwidth electrical signals over long distances. Furthermore, power consumption grows dramatically with high I\/O and peripheral bandwidth capacity required by high- performance computing systems limiting systems with electrical interconnects as currently deployed. A more power-efficient reconfigurable interconnect fabric is required to deliver the bandwidth capacity for today\u2019s applications that use PCIe-based storage and require high I\/O rates. The objective of this SBIR effort is to design, fabricate, build and test a photonic based I\/O interfaces to provide high bandwidth connectivity between the server class Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) controllers and Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) storage subsystem for DOE relevant high-performance computing applications. Freedom Photonics objective has designed and fabricated the tunable laser array and to deliver these to Columbia. Year 1 laser array utilizing discrete lasers were fabricated and delivered per schedule. Development of the base chip technology for an integrated WDM source is now ongoing according to schedule. In addition, a Phase II demonstration of low-power laser epitaxial material has been completed that allows efficient operation at 70\u00baC (only 30% penalty to room temperature). Additional achievements include the demonstration of the first active-passive integration using our high efficiency DFB lasers, in which an InP star coupler can be integrated. Columbia University has (1) designed and fabricated silicon photonic transceiver and switch fabrics and (2) design and implement subsystem controllers to support high-bandwidth and reconfigurable connectivity in the P-SSIO subsystem. During Year I and Year II, silicon photonic microdisk based transmitters and microring based filters were fabricated. They have been shown to be feasible and can support the PCIe Gen3 bandwidth requirements. Columbia has also completed the silicon photonic switch fabrics\u2019 and subsystem controllers\u2019 designs enabling dynamic resource allocation in the subsystem. The testbed demonstrated deep disaggregation of memory and PCIe resources. These initial experiments demonstrate the potential to further integrate the subsystem controller components, and to mature the switch control circuitry and packaging for future system integration. In Phase IIB, we will use Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based MPSoC development boards to implement the host, endpoint, switch nodes based on the Gen3 PCIe specification. As we developed in both Phase I and Phase II, the subsystem controllers, including the optical network controller and the optical switch controller, have been shown to be functional and operational. In Phase IIB, Columbia will further integrate these subsystem controller components with the Silicon Photonic (SiP) circuit switch, mature the switch control circuitry and packaging, and compose a SiP switch unit for the system integration. Freedom Photonics will focus on the development of the optical WDM source and packaging. The proposed Phase II effort relating to source development include adapting the base laser design for compatibility with low-cost packaging and manufacturing. The Photonic Memory Controller developed have wide commercial applications in data center and telecom markets."

        "Abstract": "Diode lasers now deliver very high powers at high efficiency, with ~70% electrical-to-optical conversion efficiency demonstrated by several groups from bars with powers of 100 W or greater. However, these devices are incoherent, multi-mode sources that cannot be focused effectively on a distant target and are not suitable for use as a directed energy weapon. Current directed energy designs rely on the use of \u201cbrightness converters\u201d \u2013 the light from such high efficiency diodes is used to pump another laser medium with high quality single mode output, such as rare earth doped solid-state crystals, glass fibers, and complex flowing alkali gas cells. These brightness converters add cost and complexity and sacrifice efficiency \u2013 wasting 50% or more of the injected diode laser energy by turning it into heat. The ideal situation would be to eliminate the brightness converter and use diode lasers directly. This would enable high energy laser (HEL) systems with dramatically reduced cost, size, weight, and power (CSWaP) requirements. However, the power and efficiency of diffraction-limited diode lasers significantly lags that of the broad area pump diodes. A significant increase in the reliable power, efficiency, and beam quality of diffraction-limited semiconductor lasers is necessary to enable HEL systems based on direct diode technology. In this proposed effort, Freedom Photonics seeks to develop and demonstrate a manufacturable, high power, high efficiency, diffraction-limited, and highly-reliable diode laser device technology. By the end of Phase 2, we will demonstrate and deliver prototype GaAs-based single emitter lasers capable of producing high output power with E\/O efficiency comparable to current multi-mode lasers, with a nearly diffraction-limited single mode output beam and excellent reliability. The primary purpose of the proposed Phase 1 effort will be to 1) demonstrate viability of the proposed laser approach to simultaneously demonstrate high power, with good efficiency, and nearly diffraction-limited beam quality, 2) to quickly assess key design aspects which will require detailed investigation during the Phase 2 effort, and 3) to develop a strategy for rapid qualification and injection of our device technology into the Department of Defense High Energy Laser applications. To these ends, the Phase 1 effort can be seen as means for mitigating technical, schedule, and business risk of the entire development program. Approved for Public Release | 20-MDA-10643 (3 Dec 20)"

In particular, the size, weight, and power consumption (SWAP) of DEW components need to be significantly reduced, especially on airborne platforms. High energy laser weapons require a track illumination laser (TIL) for target identification and tracking (pre-engagement) and aimpoint maintenance (during engagement).\u00a0 It has recently been shown that the thermal management of the TIL carries a SWAP burden which is similar to, or perhaps even higher than, the HEL itself, and a SWAP reduction is critically needed. The typical TIL is a pulsed laser operating in the 15xx-16xx nm wavelength band, and it relies on a three-stage laser architecture: 980 nm fiber-coupled pump diodes are used to pump Er\/Yb co-doped fiber laser, which in turn pumps an Er-doped crystal (such as Er:YAG) solid state laser. This system is highly inefficient (~9% wallplug conversion efficiency) and very large. A simple solution exists: direct resonant pumping of the Er:YAG solid state laser with high power diode pumps operating in the 15xx nm wavelength band can enable a dramatic reduction in the size and weight of the TIL.\u00a0 This approach can reduce the overall quantum defect from ~40% to ~7%.\u00a0 This enables a dramatic increase in wallplug conversion efficiency (from 9% up to ~24%) which in turn reduces the cooling requirements by &gt;3X.\u00a0 After initial prototype demonstration, this program will support improving the manufacturability and reliability of these InP diode pump modules in order to accelerate the transition of DEW technologies to support the warfighter."

In particular, the size, weight, and power consumption (SWAP) of Diode Laser Pump Modules (DLPMs) for HELs need to be significantly reduced.

Such high temperature DLPMs are not commercially available at this time. To fill this critical gap, Freedom Photonics (FP) and its team member Teledyne Scientific Company (TSC) propose to mature and transition their existing high temperature semiconductor diode laser pump technology, a key enabling technology for HEL systems.

        "Abstract": "RF photonic principles have been successfully utilized in the community to advance analog-to-digital converter (ADC) performance. For some applications, photonic ADCs fill an important and continuing need. However, photonic ADCs that capture more bandwidth also produce more data. The increased data stream itself gives rise to a data management and computer processing challenge that undesirably increases system size weight and power (SWaP). Another approach is to use photonics in a compressive sensing (CS) architecture. Photonic CS similarly captures signals over increased bandwidths, but uses optical pre-processing to drastically compress the data volume and produce only the information of interest. By reducing the output data stream, photonic CS systems are suitable for SWaP constrained applications that preclude photonic ADCs.\u00a0 Current efforts to miniaturize CS systems are underway, but the pulse source still needs to be addressed. To provide system benefit, the source developed in this effort must produce a pulse train having a low repetition rate between 10 to 100 MHz. Such low rep-rate mode-locked laser (MLL) sources are commonly available in fiber and free space platforms, where long cavities are easily realized such as in Er:fiber and Ti:sapphire lasers, respectively, however they suffer from large SWaP which limit their use on Naval air platforms. In this program, Freedom Photonics will investigate and develop monolithic and hybrid MLL architectures that satisfy the demanding requirements for optical signal processing applications and enable advanced photonic CS systems."

The output of this Phase I effort will be a report with test results on a drone for camera failure and structural failure, along with two system level studies, 1) feasibility of a hand-held drone defense blue laser weapon and 2) feasibility of a beam director based lethal kill laser weapon based on the NUBURU blue laser technology. Lasers are the perfect solution to dispose of and protect against drones and missiles threats.\u00a0 The use of light as the tool to dispose of the threat means an immediate hit on the target at all distances. Response rates are faster and not limited by the distance between the interceptor and the target. The use of blue laser proposes a significant advantage compared to the more common IR lasers. The absorption index for metals and plastics of blue wavelength is significantly higher than that of IR. Higher absorption rates means an improved efficiency of power delivery at the target. This enables a number of advantages, including smaller lasers (or less powerful lasers) required to enable the same functionality; shorter time needed to eliminate the risk, as the energy transfer is more efficient; higher distances at which the system is capable of eliminating the risk."

        "Abstract": "The requirements on the driving pulse for Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) kickers include extremely high peak voltage of +\/-50 kV (dual-channel) to be dissipated in a 50 Ohm kicker impedance, which brings operation peak current level to ~ 1kA. Existing drivers (pulsers) are operating at only a few kilovolts, and most of them utilize HV MOSFET switches, using single switch per each channel. However, one problem with MOSFET transistors is due to their residual resistance (on the order of several tens of Ohms), which dramatically limits their efficiency. Thus, a state-of-the-art MOSFET approach is not applicable for the EIC kickers system due to low efficiency, instability, high voltage requirements, and other solutions are sought. In response to this problem, RadiaBeam Technologies proposes to develop and test a high output pulse generator based on distributed pulser topology that will utilize novel GaN transistors as switching devices. GaN is a rapidly growing transistor platform, which enables both high peak and average power operations along with extremely short switching times of nanosecond-scale, well within very tight margins on the rise and fall times of EIC kickers. In Phase I, we will perform a thorough pulser topology optimization, resulting in an optimal combination of parallel switching sub-elements \u2013 we will find the right balance between a number of sub-elements and their individual power levels, in the context of the system performance, complexity, footprint, heat management, and power combining scheme. We will also assemble and test the switch to validate the proof-of-principle and show the scalability to 50 kV in the developed system topology. Phase I development efforts will be a starting point for actual fabrication, assembly, and high-power testing of the complete pulser system in Phase II. In addition to primary user of the system proposed herein (EIC at Brookhaven National Lab), the variants of the developed high voltage nanosecond pulser may find various applications involving HV switches or high frequency power in national laboratories, including fast beam choppers, next generation light sources using energy recovery linacs (ERLs), ion clearing gaps for ion beams, and FET-driven replacement of radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) accelerating structures. Other important applications of high voltage pulsers include: high power laser technology (i.e. to drive Pockels cells), manipulation and control of non-equilibrium plasmas, as well as for EMC\/HIRF testing of critical equipment and processes."

        "Abstract": "Metal bellows are thin-walled cylindrical components with a corrugated structure perpendicular to the cylinder axis. Bellows are used in numerous applications requiring flexible connections between vessels which must be sealed in a pressure-, temperature- and media-resistant manner. Conventional bellows geometries are highly flexible during axial, lateral and angular motion, but generally do not allow for rotational flexibility, i.e. torsion. As such, bellows users requiring rotation are often required to add expensive, custom in-vacuum motion systems to meet their alignment and\/or processing needs. In this Technology Transfer Opportunity(TTO), RadiaBeam Technologies will partner with Argonne National Lab (ANL), Castheon and Servometer to qualify, industrialize and market a torsionally flexible bellows design. This design is based on a 2020 ANL patent which incorporates hollow, re-entrant shoulders helically wound around a central bore, meant to uniformly distribute the torsionally stress. While this geometry would be extremely difficult to manufacture using conventional methods, it is perfectly suited for Additive Manufacturing, otherwise known as 3D printing. This proposal concerns the fabrication of torsionally flexible bellows using a combination of metal additive manufacturing and conventional bellows electroforming. In Phase I, we will review current bellows design with researchers at Argonne National Lab. We will 3D print both test cylinders and bellows in aluminum using the laser-powder bed fusion process. Test cylinders will be used to rapidly optimize downstream processes as well as inform our design for manufacturability. The electroformed bellows will be joined to vacuum flanges then subjected to mechanical and vacuum testing. In Phase II, the design and fabrication will be further optimized based on a series of mechanical failure tests. At the conclusion of this project, we will have developed a complete bellows fabrication process with well- characterized properties (dimensional stability, cleanliness, functionality, service life, etc). Bellows are used whenever components must retain some flexibility while also sealing in a pressure-, temperature- and media-resistant manner. Current bellows only allow for lateral, angular and axial displacement; torsional displacement is not possible. We aim to qualify and commercialize a torsionally flexible bellows design invented by Argonne National Lab. These bellows can be used to simplify the installation and alignment of vacuum systems, a key labor consideration for next generation accelerators. Furthermore, torsionally flexible bellows can be used for other vacuum-related process (analytical instrumentation, semiconductor production, etc). With further market research and product development, our first-of-its-kind product can be expanded to other markets including medical and energy."

        "Abstract": "There is a considerable and rapidly growing demand for free space propagating high power THz sources. Free Electron Laser (FEL) technology is by far the most powerful THz source technology hitherto demonstrated. However, FEL facilities are large and expensive, and could not in their present form be transformed into field deployable instruments, such as required by most applications. In response to this problem, RadiaBeam Technologies and UCLA are developing Tessatron, a THz source based on two innovations: (1) use of Tapering Enhanced Stimulated Superradiant Amplification (TESSA) high efficiency energy extraction scheme, and (2) use of a zero-slippage waveguide to support high bandwidth interaction over considerable length. As a result, numerical models indicates that Tessatron can achieve unprecedented efficiency and high output power, in a very compact footprint, while being composed of simple and robust building blocks consistent with field deployable usage. During the Phase II, the TESSA modeling tools were fully developed, and the Theseus undulator system (a key building component of Tessatron) has been designed, engineered, fabricated, tuned and fiducialized. Originally Phase II pursued a different goal of building a UV TESSA system (which is still on target). However, this work inspired the invention of the Tessatron, which represents a major commercial opportunity. In Phase IIB we propose to carry out a proof of concept Tessatron experiment at UCLA, followed by the construction of the full scale high average power Tessatron system at RadiaBeam. This project has the potential to disrupt the field of high average and peak power THz sources. There are many unique characteristics of the proposed source such as compactness, high efficiency and high bandwidth. The very high extraction efficiency will enable scaling up the average power to unprecedented levels for power-hungry security, medical and industrial applications. This is a rapidly growing cutting edge market with many exciting possibilities that can be realized by advances in THz source performance, such as pursued herein. Besides the technical and commercial benefit, this project also offers a strong scientific case, as the subject of tapered high efficiency FEL is presently at the forefront of the scholarly debate about the future of light source technology."

        "Abstract": "Over the last decade, Free Electron Laser (FEL) light sources have become essential components of the world-wide scientific infrastructure and deliver core research capabilities to Users across many scientific disciplines. However, the conventional FEL efficiency is usually limited to a small fraction of 1% at short wavelengths, which presents a significant strain on the light source accessibility and performance for a wider Users base, and for industrial applications. In response to this problem, RadiaBeam Technologies and UCLA are developing a novel concept, TESSA (Tapering Enhanced Stimulated Superradiant Amplification), which carries the promise to increase FEL efficiency by over an order of magnitude. By utilizing a high intensity radiation seed and a period-by-period undulator tapering, TESSA can achieve an overall efficiency as high as 50%. TESSA concept has been validated experimentally at 10 \u00b5m wavelength (and in a low gain regime), but it is prudent to carry out a much shorter wavelength demonstration, and also study oscillator configuration, before scaling the technology into EUV and X-rays. This project will bridge this gap, by validating and optimizing TESSA oscillator (TESSO) experimentally in the ultra-violet frequency range and in a high gain regime. During the Phase II, the TESSO design has been completed, an ultra-fast seed laser capable of generating pulse trains have been purchased, and an optical transport has been designed. In addition, the Phase II project partially supported prebuncher fiducialization, injection chicane design, section breaks development, and magnetic measurements and tuning of the first Theseus undulator section. The initial phases of the experimental program are in progress. In Phase IIA we propose to complete TESSA-266 undulator system to the full 4-m design length, commission the system, and reconfigure it as an oscillator for experimental demonstration and optimization of the pulse train operations. In this collaborative project, RadiaBeam will be mostly responsible for fabrication and development of sub-systems and components of TESSA-266 beamline, whereas UCLA will be mostly responsible for carrying the experimental program and leading optimization and data analysis. A successful TESSA oscillator demonstration in the ultraviolet frequency range, can lead to development of novel and significant additional capabilities by the FEL Light Source community. It would also trigger a broader interest towards high efficiency FEL sources, including an interest from emerging industrial applications, such as EUV lithography. For RadiaBeam the realization of TESSA concept, represents an exciting and potentially disruptive commercial opportunity."

        "Abstract": "The largest barrier to achieving &gt;100 MV\/m gradients in RF linacs is RF breakdown effects, believed to be caused by motion of defects associated with the pulsed heating and high fields. Data suggests that the use of high strength, high conductivity materials can improve linacs performance. Capturing these gains requires new design and manufacturing strategies which retain the hardened RF surface while maintaining the alignment and vacuum properties associated with high temperature brazing. We aim to improve the performance of splitcell structures through a combination of laser peening LP, copper alloying and electron beam welding EBW. LP introduces residual compressive stress into the surface and is a proven method to improve the fatigue properties of highstress, missioncritical aerospace structures. Alloying is required to increase softening temperature of copper, but careful thermomechanical engineering is needed to achieve high conductivity. Finally, low temperature joining by EBW is required to retain engineered material properties. Combined, these technologies offer a new paradigm for scalable, highgradient design and manufacturing. We demonstrated that LP could be used to engineer the hardness and electrical conductivity of pure and alloyed copper. We peened 8 unique materials, including a custom run of a high conductivity\/high strength alloy. We also peened a 3D RF surface, demonstrating technological feasibility. We performed chemical etching and EBW studies for most alloys and found that LP was compatible with current practices. Overall, LP increased hardness of all copper with negligible to minor loss in conductivity. After 400\u00b0C heat treatment, we found that these hardness\/conductivity properties changed with the magnitude and direction dependent on the alloy chemistry. We will continue development of our combined LP + alloying efforts, working with our copper foundry vendor and laser peening subcontractor. We will perform outgassing measurements, optimize etching procedures, fabricate a split cell structure with elastically averaged registration features and EBW a vacuum hermetic RF device. Testing will be performed with TE013 mushroom cavity experiments at SLAC in Year 1. In Year 2, we will perform 3cell high power RF testing of a completed laser peened EBW RF structure. The processes developed in this project will pioneer a new strategy to linacs manufacturing, with applications in both scientific and industrial accelerators. This will increase our market share of scientific and industrial accelerators. In addition, high strength\/high conductivity laser peened copper also has potential applications in power transmission, electric vehicles and reusable rocket propulsion systems."

        "Abstract": "Advanced sensors and instrumentation are required to extend the life of current nuclear power reactors, and for use in the family of next generation reactors. Such sensors must operate effectively in cooling pools and eventually in the harsh reactor environment. Current fuelrod sensors suffer from one or more of the following critical disadvantages: low reliability, requiring disassembly of the fuel rod array, requiring slow procedures, and\/or inability to measure pressure increase above nominal. Laser ultrasonic testing will be applied to meet the requirements for inpool and inreactor measurements of fuelrod pressure and cladding wall thickness. In Phase I the feasibility of applying laser ultrasonic testing for noncontact measurements of the internal pressure in nuclear fuel rods, as well as strain and cladding wall thickness, was demonstrated. This feasibility was shown for both measurements conducted in air and under water, such as in a cooling pool. The sensitivity of the measurement technique, combined with novel signalprocessing algorithms, enables detection of either overpressure or underpressure conditions. A prototype measurement system to be tested in a simulated storage pool environment will be developed. Specifications will be prepared for a radiation and temperaturehardened system to be demonstrated in a utility cooling pool during a followon Phase II effort. The end users of products developed in this project are the nuclear power utilities, and laboratories with test reactors. There is also potential for use in the International Nuclear Fusion Research and Engineering project fusion reactor and future fusion power reactors. Dualuse commercial markets include conventional coalfired or gasfired power utilities. This project will advance the Department of Energy Nuclear Sciences mission by contributing to the scientific foundation for life extension of current nuclear power plants and improved instrumentation for more efficient functioning of the next generation of power plant designs. It addresses the need for improved harsh environment sensors. Beyond the monitoring of fuel rods, the sensor is expected to also find application in monitoring other reactor components such as the containment vessel and cooling components. Use of the sensor will benefit the commercial plant operators and the manufacturers of plant components, particularly fuel rods. The public will benefit from reduced power costs and from safer, more reliable, and sustaining power generation."

        "Abstract": "As the science and technology of additive manufacturing (AM) advance, an increasing number of safety-critical aerospace components will be manufactured by AM. Specific NASA missions with AM components include the Artemis Program#39;s Orion Spacecraft and the Space Launch System, with Boeing as prime contractor. While AM has many benefits, there is a gap in the availability of reliable techniques to qualify the finished parts. Reliable qualification is especially important for safety-critical aerospace applications, as only parts that can be fully inspected can be certified for flight. In a previous NASA SBIR project, we demonstrated the feasibility of filling this gap by applying laser ultrasonic testing (LUT) for nondestructive evaluation of each AM deposited layer in real time as it is formed. This in-line inspection qualifies the part layer-by-layer, directs defect removal during the manufacturing process, and ensures qualified finished parts that require no further testing. In this proposal we describe a new type of laser ultrasonic sensor that will greatly improve the state of the art in inspection performance, leading to improved suppression of mechanical and acoustical disturbances. This performance improvement will in turn enable the implementation of a simpler and more agile beam setup and probe design. At the start of the project, we will be at TRL 3; at the end of the project, we will be at TRL 4."

        "Abstract": "Metal parts produced by additive manufacturing (AM) are scanned by computed tomography (CT) for non-destructive evaluation (NDE) to predict mechanical failure due to defects. The scans, however, require expensive equipment, substantial time, and experienced operators to run, and are difficult to properly evaluate for complex parts. We propose to replace CT with laser ultrasonic testing (LUT) as the only viable NDE alternative that can be performed in-line during the AM build. This gives close access to defects for detection, and so corrective measures can be taken before they are covered over by further deposition, or they can be scrapped early, and thus reduces cost, time, and complexity. We will show that LUT will also, like CT, predict mechanical failure. In this Phase I project we will develop metrics that effectively summarize LUT characterization of defects in AM parts, and will develop LUT data processing to calculate these metrics. We will empirically establish a statistical correlation between these metrics and mechanical strength as found by tests-to-failure of simple AM parts, and will develop a Phase II plan. We expect to reach TRL 4 by the end of Phase I, and will identify potential markets and partners for further development. Approved for Public Release | 20-MDA-10643 (3 Dec 20)"

        "Abstract": "Luna, teamed with Dr. John Bowers of UCSB, will develop an integrated chip-scale optical magnetometer with an integral Silicon\/III-V laser. This innovative product will enable new levels of performance for in situ and remote sensing in NASArsquo;s space missions. The coupling of a silicon based optical magnetometer with an on-chip light source using heterogeneous silicon photonics drastically minimizes device size, weight, and power (SWaP) while maintaining high performance magnetic field sensing. Benefitting from wafer-level fabrication, monolithically processed components allow for a sensing instrument with no moving parts which can be hardened to endure the harsh conditions of space missions. A heterogeneous Si\/III-V laser eliminates the need for a bulky, external light source by coupling light directly into the optical magnetometer either via butt-coupling or directly integrated on-chip.Phase I will prove the feasibility of a silicon optical magnetometer based on interferometric principles which can measure both magnitude and direction of a magnetic field. Studies on the sensitivity and range of the magnetometer will be completed and the design refined through high-fidelity simulations. A laboratory demonstration of a silicon photonics device with an external laser will prove the feasibility of the sensing mechanism and the approach for future system-on-chip fabrication. During Phase II, the team will fabricate a prototype silicon optical magnetometer coupled to a heterogeneously integrated silicon laser to demonstrate a lightweight, rugged, and miniature magnetometer device suitable for NASA scientific missions in space. A successful project will result in significant commercial potential and will advance the state-of-the-art of silicon photonics."

        "Abstract": "Luna has assembled a world-class team to develop an in-plane optical MEMS accelerometer integrated with an on-chip Silicon\/III-V laser. This innovative product will enable new levels of performance for Army missile inertial navigation in GPS-denied environments. The integration of the accelerometer with an on-chip light source using heterogeneous silicon photonics drastically minimizes device size, weight, and power (SWaP) while maintaining a high performance for inertial guidance. Benefitting from wafer-level fabrication, monolithically processed components allow for precise proof mass self-alignment and position sensing. An in-plane, heterogeneous Si\/III-V laser eliminates optical coupling issues and the need for a bulky, external light source by coupling light directly into the MEMS accelerometer via on-chip waveguides. Phase I will concentrate on accelerometer design, modeling, and development of the fabrication process. High-fidelity Multiphysics simulations will be carried out to validate the design and prove the feasibility of the device to meet program goals for range, bias instability, scale factor stability, and volume. A prototype of the in-plane accelerometer layout using macro scale laboratory components will be interrogated with an external laser source to prove the concept. During Phase II, the team will fabricate and test a prototype optical MEMS accelerometer system-on-chip with integrated Silicon\/III-V laser. A successful project will result in significant commercial potential and will advance the state-of-the-art in silicon photonics and optical MEMS inertial sensors."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to improve the quality of life for the estimated 38 million people in the US, and 780 million people globally, who are suffering from nail fungus (onychomycosis), a $4.5 billion global opportunity. Onychomycosis is a serious health problem without a cure and affecting quality of life. Fungal nail infections contribute to the severity of diabetic foot problems and potentially leading to tissue necrosis and ultimately lower limb amputation. Current treatments have limited efficacy, often with serious side effects; oral medications may cause liver damage, and topical antifungal drugs and lasers have low efficacy due to their limited ability to penetrate the dense and variable thickness nail plate. This project will develop an autonomous robotic debridement device to reliably, precisely, and uniformly reduce the diseased nail thickness, which can be particularly effective in combination with laser or topical treatments for improved outcomes. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will design, develop, and build an engineering prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of the novel conformal scan-based precise debridement treatment for onychomycosis. The technology offers precise and uniform polishing of the nail at the micron level, reducing the nail thickness down to its structural yet still safe limit. A 3D printing process will be developed for models used to validate design and demonstrate feasibility. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) will develop a sensor and software to provide real-time correction of optical- turbulence-induced distortion in video imagery and enable reduction of optical-turbulence-induced laser beam spread. The proposed sensor will enable distortion correction of video imagery at &gt;1 kHz update rate without the use of adaptive optics or processing of multi-image sequences. The sensor may be converted to a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor with equal or greater response bandwidth. The proposed innovation addresses the Department of Energy\u2019s objective to increase standoff range and minimize measurement noise in remote sensing applications by exploiting edge sensing. The objective of the Phase I project is to demonstrate that correction of optical-turbulence-induced image distortion can be accomplished faster and in a more computationally-efficient way using data from an event camera rather than processing a multi-image sequence. We believe that event cameras are ideally- suited for this application because they provide a continuous asynchronous stream of high-bandwidth (&gt;100 kHz) of intensity change data necessary to determine the distortion correction. Data provided by event cameras is not frame-rate-limited because they do not output frames; that they only output spatially- resolved change information greatly reduces data throughput relative to a conventional video camera. The Phase I program will demonstrate that data from an event camera may be used to correct optical- turbulence-induced image distortion faster and more efficiently than can be accomplished by direct processing of video sequences. The Phase I program will be consist of data collection, algorithm development, and data analysis. We will collect imagery through a turbulent atmosphere using a commercially-available event camera which has a conventional (40 Hz) video output as well as event output. To demonstrate proof-of-principle, we will: 1) develop an algorithm to distortion-correct video using an event camera data stream, 2) distort-correct imagery using that algorithm, 3) distort-correct imagery using an establish video processing method and 4) compare the results of the two approaches. Presuming a favorable result in #4, we will develop a conceptual for a sensor to be built in Phase II. The proposed sensor will be used in conjunction with an imaging sensor or laser-based illumination system to improve the spatial resolution of imagery and to enable laser illumination systems to deliver more power on target. Applications of the proposed sensor include: Image quality enhancement of airborne surveillance imagery. Image quality enhancement of ground-level tactical, ship-board and surveillance imagery. Increase energy on target for laser designators and high-power laser weapons."

        "Abstract": "SUMMARY\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the U.S. Wet AMD\naccounts for up to 90% of vision loss in AMD patients, which is characterized by choroidal neovascularization\n(CNV). Currently, no cure exists for AMD, and available drug therapies focus on intravitreal injection of anti-\nvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents. These anti-VEGF drugs have achieved impressive therapeutic\neffects on CNV in approximately 70% of AMD patients; however, the other 30% of patients remain unresponsive\nto anti-VEGF therapies. AMD is a multi-factorial disease\uff0ctherapies that only target a single molecule (such as\nVEGF) do not benefit for all patients with AMD. Therefore, the development of new drugs to target multiple\npathogenic factors with a single compound, is an unmet clinical need. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor\n\u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) is a widely expressed, ligand-activated transcriptional factor. Recent studies provide strong evidence\nsupporting that PPAR\u03b1 agonist could suppress the vicious cycle of chronic inflammation in the RPE and retina,\na key cause in the pathogenesis of AMD. In addition, clinical studies have demonstrated that oral treatment of\nfenofibrate (an agonist of PPAR\u03b1) could significantly reduce the need of laser photocoagulation for retinal\nneovascularization by 37-40%. PPAR\u03b1 agonist inhibits neovascularization and overproduction of multiple\ninflammatory factors in AMD animal models. Meanwhile, as small molecules, PPAR\u03b1 agonists can penetrate\nthrough the blood-retinal barrier, making it a promising novel oral option for the prevention and treatment of AMD.\nHowever, fenofibrate\u2019s low specificity, low potency, and dose-limiting toxicities make it a non-ideal treatment\noption for AMD. Recently, our team has independently designed, synthesized, and screened more than 200 new\nPPAR\u03b1 agonists, from which we identified a novel non-fibrate compound A190, with significantly improved\npotency and selectivity for PPAR\u03b1 agonism (EC50 = \u223c37 nM). It activates PPAR\u03b1 and upregulates expression\nof PPAR\u03b1 target genes in retinal cells, and confers anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective\neffects superior to fenofibrate. It also reduces retinal inflammation and vascular leakage in AMD models. We will\nevaluate the effects of A190 on retinal NV and inflammation in AMD animal models. The project will be achieved\nby two specific aims. Specific Aim 1: Determine whether A190 suppresses subretinal NV. Specific Aim 2:\nDetermine whether A190 inhibits oxidative stress\/inflammation. The proposed studies will prove the therapeutic\neffect of this compound on AMD models and will lay a solid ground for further PK, toxicity, mechanism studies in\nfuture Phase II project.PROJECT NARRATIVE\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. Currently, there is\nno cure for AMD. PPAR\u03b1 confers anti-inflammation and anti-neovascularization functions. Our novel\nPPAR\u03b1 agonist A190 has great potential to become an effective drug for the treatment of AMD."

        "Abstract": "With this potential application as photocathode injector in the Linac Coherent Light Source-II (LCLS-II), AdValue Photonics proposes to develop a compact, high-power, picosecond Yb-doped fiber-based laser at 1030nm and its 4th-harmonic generation at 257.5nm based on our well-commercialized fiber-based high-power picosecond green laser technology (50W average power at 515nm for glass cutting industrial application). An all-fiber mode-locked Yb-doped fiber laser, which was developed during the period of the year 2013~2016 under the support from another DoE SBIR program (entitled \u201c100W Mode-locked Green Laser for GaAs Photoemission Guns\u201d), delivers sub-picosecond laser pulses at 1030nm from a compact robust mechanical package. With a very short piece of chirped fiber Bragg grating and an AOM-based pulse picker, flat-top laser pulses with a pulse duration of ~20ps at a repetition frequency ~5 MHz near 1030nm will be generated as the seed laser. These well-tailored seed laser pulses will then be amplified up to mega-watt peak power by using our patented technology \u2013 a high-power, high-efficient Yb-doped fiber amplifier chain in an all-fiber monolithic compact platform. In the Phase I program, we promise to demonstrate &gt;20W output power of 20ps laser pulses at 257.5nm at ~5MHz rep rate. The Phase II program will build a prototyping unit demonstrating such a compact UV laser at 257.5nm with 25W average power, 20ps pulse duration at ~5MHz rep rates and a 100W infrared laser at 1030nm as well, for its potential use in the photocathode injector in the Linac Coherent Light Source-II. In addition to its potential application in high-power synchrotron light sources, our proposed high-power, fiber-based, picosecond lasers from a UV wavelength to green and infrared wavelengths are also very useful for industrial material processing applications, for example high-precision laser cutting and drilling. One rapidly growing segment of the materials processing market is micro materials processing where ultrafast lasers. Ultrafast lasers provide a superior advantage when compared to CW, QCW or other pulsed lasers in certain applications where drilling, cutting and structuring quality and precision is critical, especially when working with sensitive materials and non-metals. Industrial needs for micro material processing application by using ultrafast lasers include aeronautics, electronics, medical and scientific industry segments. This market is dominated today by solid state lasers, however, fiber-based hybrid lasers utilizing specialty fibers in the master oscillator or amplifications stages are gaining traction. Market shift towards cloud computing, 5G technology, and OLED based flat panel displays to name a few, are driving the need for cost effective, scalable and ruggedized ultrafast fiber laser solutions to address the growing requirements of processing new and advanced materials in high volume."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in demonstrating a new laser used for the complex computer networks of the high-performance computing (HPC) and data communications industries. HPCs are critical for studying many complex scientific phenomena. Likewise, cloud datacenters represent the backbone of the pervasive connectivity that enables mobile computing, communications, and networking. Both HPCs and datacenters are increasingly reliant on advanced techniques to link hundreds of thousands of computers. The proposed project enables new systems with improved performance, efficiency, reliability, and cost. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will focus on optimizing the performance of novel semiconductor quantum dot based multiwavelength laser sources. Multiwavelength lasers with adequate output power and low noise for commercial applications have long proven challenging due to gain competition between lasing modes and dispersion. The designs and materials platform developed in this project address these challenges directly. The quantum dot gain material provides stability against the traditional barriers to multiwavelength laser performance. By optimizing material properties and device designs, the gain competition between dot sub-populations and the effects of dispersion will be minimized. This can be used for various integrated circuit chips, including ethernet switches, graphics processing units, and field-programmable gate arrays. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Project Summary\/AbstractThe primary goal of this research project is to develop and pre-clinically validate a novel electrohydraulic\nimpact (EHI) device that will aid clinicians in treating patients with peripheral artery chronic total occlusions\n(CTOs). CTOs represent the complete blockage of the blood vessels and are difficult to recanalize using\ntraditional percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) techniques and apparatus. The presence of\ncalcifications and fibrotic tissues within CTOs, together with the vessel size and tortuosity, are the causes of\nmultiple complications during treatment. Therefore, a significant number of CTOs are treated using an invasive\nbypass surgery, which has significant morbidity and requires extensive recovery time. The central challenge to\ncatheter based nonsurgical percutaneous CTO treatment is that it often is incredibly difficult to cross the\ncalcified and resistant chronic blockage with an angioplasty wire. Although efforts have been made to use\nexcimer lasers or rotational atherectomy devices (rotablator), these plaque modification devices require a wire\nto cross the CTO, which limits their utility if no wire crossing is established. To address this clinically important\nproblem of difficult CTO crossing, Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) in collaboration with Brigham and Womenandapos;s\nHospital (BWH) and Impact Vascular (IVAS) proposes to develop and pre-clinically evaluate a novel and safer\nmethod and device for CTO management. The proposed device uses an electrohydraulic impactor that creates\na directed impact pressure of several hundred bar to penetrate the CTO plaque without damaging normal elastic\narterial tissue. Therefore, EHI will facilitate CTO crossing and distal guide-wire passage to enable definitive\ntreatment with balloons and stents.Project Narrative\nGlobally more than 200 million people suffer from peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and the number\nis continuously growing. A large percentage of PAOD patients have chronic total occlusions (CTOs) in which\nperipheral artery is completely blocked by an atherosclerotic narrowing. Peripheral arterial CTOs are a leading\ncause of leg pain, nonhealing ulcers, and extremity amputation. Timely and effective treatment of CTOs is an\nimportant factor in improving patient outcomes and salvaging ischemic limbs."

(PSI), in collaboration with the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Womenandapos;s\nHospital (BWH), proposes to develop an automated Smart Multi-grid-guidance Template (SMT) technology\nthat will enable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided transperineal focal therapy improvement of prostate\ncancer (PCa). Focal therapy that targets localized PCa lesions is a growing therapeutic option for PCa patients\nwith unifocal, low- and intermediate-risk cancer. Various energy therapy modalities, such as cryoablation,\nlaser ablation, radiofrequency ablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound, have been clinically investigated\nwith regards to improving post-treatment preservation of sexual and urinary function while focally treating\nPCa. Although these PCa focal therapy modalities have widely been utilized in conjunction with the imaging-\nguided approaches for precise localization of PCa lesions, accurate placement of the therapy needles within\nthe PCa lesions remains a major challenging problem in improving the PCa therapy success rate. Therefore,\nthere is a clinical need for a technology that can provide highly accurate placement of multiple therapy\nneedles onto the targeted PCa lesions during focal therapy. During Phase I, PSI\/BWH team will focus on the\nvalidation of the potential impact of the SMT system on focal cryoablation therapy. A preclinical prototype of\nthe SMT system will be developed, optimized on a prostate phantom, and then its accuracy for needle\nplacement will be tested ex vivo on excised animal prostate glands. Additionally, its capability to provide real-\ntime needle monitoring and accurate placement of multiple therapy needles will be evaluated in vivo on a\nlarge animal model during MRI-guided focal cryoablation procedures. Based on the Phase I results and\nconclusions, a robust SMT system with improved performance for clinical use in various focal therapy\nmodalities will be proposed to be developed and validated on human patients in Phase II.Project Narrative\nThe central focus of this project is to improve the therapeutic accuracy of MRI-guided transperineal focal\ntreatment in prostate cancer by providing precise therapy needle placement using a Smart Multi-grid\nTemplate technology. The proposed device will improve the prostate cancer therapy success rate, reduce\nthe risk of overtreatment for early-stage prostate cancer, and ultimately improve the quality of life for patients\nand their families."

The proposal will lead to a near-real-time in-situ reagentless sensor on the International Space Station (ISS) and for future spacecraft for human missions for detection and quantification of the microbial bioburden in potable water, air, and on surfaces. The MAIA (Microbial Assessment with In-situ Autofluorescence) instrument mitigates the challenges of current microbial detection methods being used by enabling an in-line, autonomous,nbsp;nbsp;reagentless method, with detection sensitivities down to a single microbial cell, and require minimal crew time. MAIA also limits the number of consumables needed for long duration missions.nbsp;During the Phase 1 proposal we migrated the MAIA methodology from TRL 2 to TRL 3 in six months by retiring risks of the critical items, demonstrated feasibility, and developed a design solution that will be implemented under this Phase 2 program.nbsp;nbsp;In Phase 2, a prototype MAIA instrument will be developed and tested for automated microbial analysis in water, air, and for surfaces.nbsp;nbsp;The MAIA instrument design and development will occur in 1.5 years with testing in the remaining 0.5 years.

        "Abstract": "This proposal addresses the need for detection of multiple biological threats in a manner that mitigates the current challenges with short analysis times without environmental interferences. This proposal will lead to a near-real-time in-situ reagentless portable sensor that enables detection and identification of multiple biological threats using deep UV laser induced native fluorescence\/Raman spectroscopy combined with an air sampling system and a separation\/concentration methodology for bacterial and viral pathogens. The ARIEL (Airborne Risk Identification Enabled by Raman and Luminescence) instrument mitigates the challenges of current microbial detection methods being used by enabling a reagentless method, with detection sensitivities down to a single microbial cell\/virus, and requires minimal user interaction. \n\nDuring the Phase 1 proposal we will migrate the ARIEL methodology from TRL 2 to TRL 3 in five months. The effort will capitalize on current deep UV instrumentation at Photon Systems to demonstrate and verify ARIELs detection and identification of microbial threats in natural air samples. The deep UV methodology has been previously shown to enable microbial detection and differentiability for bacterial cells, spores, and viruses. This Phase 1 effort will demonstrate this capability in the proposed sampling and analysis implementation using an air sampling concentration\/separation system, developed for this effort, and assess any effect of that environmental contaminants may have on identification. These results will demonstrate proof of concept of the method and further refine the implementation and specific parameters of the ARIEL instrument for Phase 2"

        "Abstract": "Coherent lidar is useful for many applications including navigation, imaging, ranging and Doppler velocimetry during spacecraft landing, proximity operations, hazard avoidance, and docking. A reliable source of coherent modulated optical waveforms is required for simultaneous ranging and velocimetry. Existing sources are bulky since they require large electronic bandwidth, fragile fiber-based lasers and other discrete components, modulators, or long optical delay lines. This makes coherent lidar systems difficult to miniaturize for small platforms such as cubeSats, smallSats, and autonomous aerial and land vehicles.nbsp;We propose to develop a low power, mass and size photonic integrated circuit (PIC) that implements a high data rate coherent lidar transceiver operating at the 1550 nm wavelength. The innovation is based on a new method to generate frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) laser radiation that relies on optical components present on a PIC only and does not use optical phase locked loops or modulators. This new architecture enables extremely compact and low cost coherent lidar engine for navigation, imaging and object detection."

        "Abstract": "Ti-6Al-4V is a commonly-used alloy in aerospace and defense applications. Additive manufacturing or AM (particularly laser powder-bed fusion, or LPBF) has successfully been used to manufacture Ti-6Al-4V to lower material usage, reduce lead times, and create parts with complex geometries. ASTM standards dictate heat treatment procedures for traditionally manufactured Ti-6Al-4V, but the resulting microstructural changes on AM parts have not yet been modeled and are not completely understood. It is desired to create an experimentally-validated computational model that quantifies structure-property-process relationships for LPBF Ti-6Al-4V. \u00a0In the Phase I project, Lynntech team demonstrated feasibility of a first principles based computational scheme to calculate microstructural properties of LPBF Ti-6Al-4V as a function of different heat treatment procedures.\u00a0 Simultaneous experimental evaluation of these properties was also conducted with commercial LPBF Ti-6Al-4V samples.\u00a0 Based on the information gathered about the effect of post-fabrication heat treatment on microstructure, a deep understanding has been developed to serve as a foundation upon which advanced modeling techniques can be employed to predict materials property changes due to heat-treatment.\u00a0 During the proposed Phase II project, Lynntech team will combine the computational and experimental approaches learned in the Phase I project, with machine learning tools to create a robust computational tool for predicting microstructural and mechanical properties of the LPBF Ti-6Al-4V samples after heat treatment procedures. \u00a0The results will be validated through heat treatment experiments followed by tension and fatigue tests of commercial LPBF Ti-6Al-4V samples. \u00a0During Phase III, a plan will be generated to transition the results of the study to end-use applications in the additive manufacturing of near-net-shape parts for the US Army. An optimized heat-treatment process for L-PBF Ti-6Al-4V will be proposed based on computational optimization."

Innovations such as new means to transfer efficiently power from one low-loss integrated passive waveguide to another to achieve monolithic beam combining will be modeled. Additionally, novel bandstructure designs capable of improving the performance of two-color laser emitters over the current state-of-the-art MWIR QCLs will be implemented. The packaging of our laser source will also be engineered to have a volume of less than one cubic centimeter and weighing less than 100 grams volume less one cubic centimeter and weighing less than 100 grams."

        "Abstract": "The broader\/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to advance high-accuracy, rapid, on\u2010shop floor or in\u2010machine dimensional measurements of precision machined parts. These measurements are conducted with Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMM), representing a $4 B market. The proposed project will develop a new portable CMM instrument for precision machine shops, bottlenecked by their high\u2010cost stationary CMMs or limited by low-accuracy portable CMMs. In\u2010machine part inspection will reduce waste for one\u2010off or prototyping shops. It will further improve CNC machining process control of large batch jobs by allowing rapid statistical sampling of the accuracy of CNC-machined parts mid\u2010process. The new technology will improve efficiency and accuracy in machine shops, lowering the cost of manufactured parts. The intellectual merit of this project is to surmount two primary technical hurdles needed to complete a working prototype of the new interferometer\u2010based Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM). These hurdles include the development of an absolute distance interferometer measurement system, tuned specifically for the novel CMM, and the development of the custom mechanical, optical, and data acquisition\/processing systems required for its function. The new interferometer\u2010based CMM will have multiple inherent advantages over existing portable CMMs, including sensitivity, absolute accuracy (tied directly to the wavelength of light) and long\u2010term reliability. The novel approach addresses many challenges in the 3D metrology domain. Research tasks include diode laser frequency locking with high absolute accuracy, merging of multiple absolute distance interferometry methods, construction and optimization of the mechanical and optical systems, and integration of software and hardware. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be enabling a disruptive architectural shift for future cloud and high performance computing (HPC) networks. The project will result in a single laser that can generate multiple wavelengths. These multiple wavelengths can each have different data encoded on them and can be sent to different destinations. This allows this single laser to interconnect multiple network nodes simultaneously. The increased connectivity resulting from this technology can unlock significant performance accelerations in HPC and cloud networks. Accelerated HPC performance will increase the rate of fundamental scientific discoveries because HPC is essential for advancing our basic understanding of many complex large-scale scientific phenomena. The envisioned product will be a semiconductor laser that emits multiple wavelengths that can be used to interconnect multiple nodes in a network. The commercial impacts of the proposed activity will be improved performance and cost of HPC and datacenter networks. Potential customers include manufacturers of optical transceivers as well as systems integrators of microelectronic computing. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enhance understanding of novel semiconductor laser and amplifier component operating principles. This enhanced understanding will be used to inform innovative optical interconnect designs capable of meeting the challenging performance requirements specified by the end applications. The project will enable a systematic design study entailing material science, semiconductor laser physics, as well as device engineering in order to evaluate the feasibility of creating a laser product with sufficient performance. This performance includes low signal-to-noise ratio per wavelength as required for error-free communication. Specifically, the goal is to make a single laser that can emit 32 usable wavelengths, each with at least 1 mW of output power and with competitive relative intensity noise levels. This SBIR Phase I study will be an opportunity to evaluate the design space and assess the plausibility of such a laser for commercial use, while contributing to basic understanding of the relevant technology.

Currently, devices with high-resolution microchannels are typically manufactured using sophisticated cleanroom microfabrication facilities, requiring technical expertise, high costs, and long turnaround times; these factors inhibit their use. This project will enable rapid manufacturing of customized microfluidics devices with substantially lower costs and turnaround times. This technology will impact research in applications including fundamental cell biology, drug screening, cellular therapy, toxicity testing, and tissue engineering. This SBIR Phase I project will advance the translation of hybrid laser printing (HLP), combining the quick and large-scale printing capability of Continuous Liquid Interface Production (CLIP) with precision processing of additive multiphoton polymerization (MPP) and subtractive multiphoton ablation (MPA) into a single versatile machine. Technical challenges in material discovery and scalability will be addressed in this work: 1) Discover new materials not only compatible with HLP process but also showing the necessary durability, transparency, biocompatibility, and impermeability to fluids; and characterize key HLP parameters, such as ablation z-range used in MPA mode and dead-zone thickness used in CLIP mode; and 2) Scale the maximum printable size of HLP process using a novel multiscale CLIP strategy combined with a step-stitch projection printing method. The project will develop a prototype for life sciences applications.

        "Abstract": "Quantum information technologies are poised to revolutionize and open new era in modern computation and communication. To maintain its traditional leadership in providing high-performance computing and communications to support open science, DOE convened a series of workshop, roundtable and programs to explore the challenges and opportunities associated with developing quantum networks to enable distributed quantum applications. Among all potential physical realizations of quantum information, photonic-based quantum system appears to be the most promising implementation. Additionally, well-established and matured optical telecommunication network technologies and devices can be leveraged to develop cost-effective optical quantum networks that can coexist with classical networks in shared optical fiber transmission systems. The development of bright quantum light sources is extremely important for on-going quantum network programs in DOE\u2019s national labs, such as Oak Ridge National Lab ORNL) and Brookhaven National Lab BNL). Raytum Photonics and Quantum Optics &amp; Quantum Information research group at University of Maryland, Baltimore County UMBC) propose to develop an ultra-bright quantum light source using entangled two-mode state. This proposal directly answers DOE\u2019s call for photonics quantum light source in topic 6a to develop photonic quantum light sources. Our proposed innovative two-mode entangled quantum light source will significantly increase the brightness in comparison with conventional photonic quantum light source based on biphoton entanglement from SPDC. This bright quantum light source is basically a specially designed multi-mode, high-Q, ring cavity, all-fiber based Optical Parametric Oscillator OPO) that generates multi-channel non-factorizable state of entangled signal-idler cavity mode-pair. The proposed quantum light source is pumped by single frequency DBF laser at ~780nm, and uses QPM wave-guided type II MgO: PPLN for frequency down conversion. The output beams are orthogonally polarized signal-idler pairs at telecommunication wavelength ~ 1550nm. The most significant innovation of this proposal is that entanglement is between two cavity modes in OPO instead of two photons in SPDC. This makes the proposed quantum light source \u201cultra-bright\u201d and is orders of magnitude higher than conventional one through SPDC. With thousands of pairs of entangled signal-idler mode, this ultra-bright quantum light source is also designed for multi-channel quantum communication. Raytum Photonics will collaborate with researchers in Oakridge National Lab to test the quantum light source in quantum communication projects."

        "Abstract": "The Department of Energy has a mission to ensure America&apos;s prosperity and security by addressing energy and environmental challenges. Increased use of renewable energy is important to preserve our current climate and avoid continued negative impacts. Rare Earth Elements are necessary and in demand for wind turbines and electric vehicle manufacturing. Currently, Rare Earth Elements are mined, separated and purified primarily in China, then imported to the USA. Current separation and purification techniques use excessive organic solvents and require large and expensive processing equipment. This Phase I project aims to develop a separation and purification process. Our innovative process will allow for the production of domestic, cost- effective, and environmentally sustainable Rare Earth Elements from coal mining byproducts including refuse and acid mine drainage. The use of supercritical carbon dioxide eliminates the need for hazardous organic solvents and substantially reduces the need for expensive and hazardous acids. CF Technologies, Inc. will receive concentrated rare earth elements from processed coal byproducts from mining experts at the University of Kentucky. Commercial application and benefits of this successful technology will provide a domestic source of light and heavy Rare Earth Elements for the magnet, automotive and laser industries. Worldwide demand for these pure elements is on the order of 170,000 tonnes. Utilizing the coal mine waste streams represents an opportunity to produce 30,000 tonnes, without the requirement to do any additional mining. Our separation and purification technology can also be used at existing and future Rare Earth Element mines to eliminate the need to export for separation services. The environmental benefits of extracting valuable materials from existing waste streams allow for sustainable product manufacturing and preservation of our natural resources."

        "Abstract": "High performance, high brightness photocathodes are a critical enabling technology for ultrafast, high brightness DOE electron accelerators, such as the X-ray free electron laser FEL) at SLAC and MaRIE planned for Los Alamos National Laboratory, and for high-resolution electron microscopes at DOE material research centers. A novel approach to manufacturing nitride semiconductor materials will be developed and applied to produce intense photocathode technology that will advance the science of the study of high energy density plasmas, as well as research in materials science, physics, biology, and chemistry. Kyma will maximize beam current and minimize the mean transverse energies in novel Group III-Nitride based photocathodes by taking advantage of the pulsed sputter deposition technique to achieve unrealized doping control and smoothness in photocathode devices, giving rise to high quantum efficiencies and low mean transverse energy. In Phase I Kyma will utilize pulsed sputtering to create doped layers and heterostructures which will bode well for producing economical, environmentally robust, bright photocathodes. The research to be performed under this program will facilitate ultra-high performance and cost- effective radiation detection devices, which will find applications in quantifying radiation yields in a variety of nuclear experiments including Underground Nuclear Test, Advanced Radiography, Inertial Confinement Fusion, Device and Dynamic Material Properties, and other campaigns within Stockpile Stewardship and Nonproliferation programs. The ability to use pulsed sputtering to produce the materials for the photomultipliers has enormous ramifications for application to most if not all Group III- Nitride devices, including LEDs, laser diodes, power electronics, and high frequency electronics."

        "Abstract": "High brightness photocathodes PCath) are needed for DOE facilities and laboratories employing electron accelerators used for Free Electron Lasers FEL), ultrafast electron microscopy, and diffraction. Typically alkali-antimonide cathodes, alkali-telluride, GaAs or metals are used; these semiconductor based PCaths have shown superior performances with respect to metals, however they are highly reactive and rapidly degrade even in isolated ultra-high vacuum UHV) enclosures over hours\/days to at most months\u2019 due to chemical poisoning or loss of alkali metals. The proposed non cesiated III-N based photocathodes will solve this continuing difficult chemical degradation of state-of-the-art photocathodes. The III-N photocathodes will be chemically stable, over extended times without exotic passivation in atmosphere and in vacuum while retaining higher quantum efficiency. This will be achieved by using the spontaneous stress-induced piezoelectric polarization field in the properly oriented nitrides and through band engineering and device designs. In Phase I project. the design for III-N based photocathodes to achieve negative electron affinity NEA) along with other properties of the photocathode will be demonstrated. The designed III-N based structure for photocathodes will also be grown and will be evaluated for proof of concept performance. The developing of photocathodes with longer life, higher quantum efficiency and low intrinsic emittance will allow future upgrades of the DOE facilities such as X-ray Free Electron Lasers XFELs) and ultra-fast electron diffraction UED). Improving these facilities will enable advancement in science studies of the dynamic evolution of chemical and physical processes with the resolution of a few femtoseconds 1 fs = 10-15 sec), and thus further unraveling the complex dynamics of the molecular structure of a single protein or virus. This project will have immense impact on scientific and technological understanding of materials."

        "Abstract": "As the capabilities of synchrotron and free electron laser FEL) sources increase, so too do the technical requirements of materials utilized for the x-ray optics in these sources. Due to its low atomic number and extremely high thermal diffusivity, x-ray transparency, radiation resistance, and mechanical strength, diamond is an ideal material for synchrotron and FEL optics. However, improvement to crystalline quality are necessary in order to prevent distortion of the x-rays and subsequent loss of monochromaticity, flux or other desired beamline requirements. Single crystal silicon is most commonly used today due to its wide availability and high crystalline quality. However, the previously mentioned physical properties are far superior for diamond compared to that of silicon. Additionally, silicon optics need to be cryogenically cooled via liquid nitrogen, necessitating additional equipment complexity whereas diamond optics do not. The problem with diamond optics available today is that the crystalline quality remains too low for diffraction applications. This phase I project aims to develop a prototype process capable of manufacturing single crystal diamond optics of sufficient size and crystalline quality to meet the stringent requirements for an x-ray optic. To achieve these results a chemical vapor deposition process is proposed to grow diamond via traditional homoepitaxy and novel heteroepitaxial methods that iteratively improve the crystalline lattice until near-perfect lattice constants and quality are achieved. This will be achieved through reduction in impurities and thermal gradients during the growth process, resulting in lower stress and fewer defects in the final material. At the conclusion of Phase I, a single crystal diamond will be produced possessing a thermal conductivity of no less than 1800 W\/m\u00b7K) with a size of at least 6x6x4mm^3. Development of pristine quality diamond bodies of significant size has great commercial potential in a wide range of areas. As an ultra-wide bandgap material, diamond LEDs have the potential to replace toxic and expensive mercury vapor lamps in water purification, as well as for deep-UV lithography for nano-scale device fabrication. Additionally, diamond has already proven to be a superior material for semiconductor substrates in high-frequency and high-power applications, including power infrastructure, communications and military radar. Diamond also has great potential for room- temperature quantum computing by exploiting NV centers within the diamond body. Due to high rigidity, diamond is also an ideal material for a number of MEMS devices, include SAW devices used for transmitting and receiving signals in mobile phones and other mobile devices."

        "Abstract": "Next-generation of synchrotron and Free-Electron Laser X-ray sources will increase the peak power by several orders of magnitude. Diamond single crystals optical elements are promising for these radiation sources, where X-ray intensity will become too severe for the other existing materials. Increased X-ray power density imposes very high demands on the purity and structural quality of diamond substrates. Presently, the availability of large size, high-crystallinity, and low-defect density diamond substrates is very limited. There are no suppliers at all in the United States to support this rapidly developing field of diamond X-ray optics applications for the next generation sources. We will develop an advanced microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition MPE CVD) reactor system, which would allow for fabrication of the highest crystallinity and very low defect density single crystal diamond substrates. This unique technology will enable a growth large type IIa or better diffraction-grade crystals with improved thermo-conductivity characteristics and comparable crystallinity of the best available high-pressure high-temperature diamond samples. The innovation is based on recently patented Euclid\u2019s MPE-CVD diamond reactor technology. In Phase I, we will determine all necessary means for MPE CVD reactor parameters and operation and design the system to satisfy crystals quality imposed by demand of next-generation synchrotron and FEL X-ray facilities. We model and design key elements of the CVD reactor, in particular a modified substrate holder, for optimal SC diamond growth. In parallel we develop a growth strategy that expands the size of the seed crystal while minimizing strain and dislocation density using numerical modeling. We will also obtain extremely high-quality diamond seeds and prepare ultra-smooth surfaces needed for epitaxial growth. Material characterization before and after surface preparation will be conducted at APS ANL facilities using white-beam X-ray topography, sequential rocking curve mapping, high- resolution x-ray diffraction measurements. The technology developed here is required to utilize X-ray beams at fourth generation light sources to maximum potential. High-quality diamond is virtually the only material that can withstand the heat load of the next generation light sources. If a manufacturing technology for large size CVD diamond substrate is established, diamond-based optical elements will supersede the current silicon and beryllium alternatives, which have lower performance and severe health and safety concerns. High-quality diamond material will also benefit quantum computing, industrial, medical, and other industrial applications."

        "Abstract": "DOE nuclear imaging research requires large detector arrays and highly segmented detector electrode geometries. These designs are difficult to implement with available packaging and interconnect methods. There is a need for low-cost, reliable electronic interconnect fabrication tools with capability to build sophisticated geometries from the microelectronics level to large detector array scale. Our Localized Laser Chemical Vapor Deposition CVD) technique meets these requirements because it can deposit material layers with consistent dimensions, strong bonding strength, and various packaging geometries including planar and curved surfaces. This capability ensures production of stable electrical components with consistent circuit performance. The technique can fabricate multiple layers from different materials simultaneously by switching chemical precursors, and can be scaled to connect signals of different packaging dimensions, such as from dense large array signal paths to CMOS circuit connection with detector pixels. Our proposed Phase I R&amp;D objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of using localized laser Chemical Vapor Deposition CVD) to print interconnection materials between circuits and electronic components on different substrates and surface geometries. During Phase I we will modify our existing laser CVD design for large scale sensor application requirements and demonstrate 3D additive printing on planar silicon wafers and curvedsubstrates. We will also investigate printing on vertical surfaces through laser source orientation adjustment, and define design requirements for integrating the tool with robotic positioners. Phase II will produce a commercially viable prototype Laser CVD and methodology capable of printing conductive materials to interconnect high-density front-end CMOS circuits with silicon detector layers for large scale detector array construction. We have successfully demonstrated electrical circuit fabrication in our prototype laser CVD chamber. This work was performed under a DoD SBIR Phase I seeking additive manufacturing methods for building conformal 3D) circuits at various integration scales. We are commercializing this technology through corporate funds andpatents. Our Phase I proposal briefly describes Laser CVD and how it may solve the DOE requirement for large detector array integration, along with a detailed work plan for demonstrating conformal interconnect fabrication. Dr. Zhigang Xiao, the PI for this project and founder of Microcvd Corporation, has over 20 years experiences in both CVD and ink jet printing product development. The Microcvd engineering staff has the required expertise in vapor deposition and optical engineering for modifying our CVD prototype to demonstrate conformal, multi-scale interconnection of large array electronics. This Phase I work will result in design requirements and development plan for the Phase II commercial product prototype."

The Phase II, specially the MZI based approach, enabled us to demonstrate record breaking optical links and set the stage for the commercialization stage. The exceptional high power and high temperature operation of the lasers developed by Freedom Photonics and the low loss coupling work performed by PLCC has made the planning for Phase IIb more straightforward.

        "Abstract": "Water vapor plays a key role in Earth\u2019s climate and weather patterns. Accurate, high resolution measurements of the water vapor vertical profiles in a region have been found to significantly improve the numerical weather prediction models\u2019 short-term forecasts, precipitation forecasts, as well as severe weather forecasts. However, current measurement techniques provide very coarse resolution in space, time, and\/or altitude. A network of continuously sampling water vapor profilers would greatly expand the scientific knowledge of the atmosphere and serve as a valuable input into numerical weather models. This would be of interest not only to the Department of Energy\u2019s Environmental Sciences Division but to other institutions such as the National Weather Service, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the military. Differential absorption lidar has the potential to greatly improve the resolution and accuracy of atmospheric water vapor measurements when integrated into a global network, but, while there are some research-grade systems, there doesn\u2019t exist a commercial one with the potential for deployment into a sensing network. One promising research-grade lidar system is based on two narrow-linewidth amplified laser-diodes micro- pulsed at high repetition rates with state-of-the-art optical filtering in the photon-counting receivers. This instrument has already demonstrated strong performance in field campaigns over the last 5 years. The overall goal of this SBIR work is to transition this sensor from its current state as a mobile laboratory to a streamlined instrument commercially available for widespread deployment. Such a system promises to provide continuous monitoring of water vapor vertical profiles in an autonomous, eye-safe instrument that can be deployed in a network of sensors at relatively low cost and requiring minimal maintenance. The Phase I work was focused on developing several upgrades to the transmitter subsystem of the lidar instrument. These upgrades were designed to reduce the system size and, more importantly, its cost and complexity without sacrificing any performance. The laser control and wavelength locking electronics were all consolidated onto a single board and all the transmitter optics were fiber coupled to eliminate drift due to misalignment. In this Phase II project, the recently developed upgrades will be incorporated into the main lidar system for validation and long-term, autonomous testing. To ensure autonomous field operation extra remote control and monitor functionality will be added, including a robust software package and communication library. An improved instrument will be constructed and tested both in controlled laboratory conditions and a mission relevant field campaign. A streamlined prototype system will be developed for beta testing with early adopters in a follow-on Phase IIB proposal to transition this instrument into a commercial product line."

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in computing systems have fundamentally changed and shaped almost every aspect of today\u2019s society. From healthcare to finances to scientific discoveries, our everyday lives will depend more and more on computing and communication infrastructures and their capability to process and deliver critical information in real time. However, as high-performance-computing systems and datacenters already consume megawatts of power, sustainable scaling of future computing systems must consider energy-efficient, parallel, and accelerated heterogeneous processing that can be commercially deployed. The proposed project pursues energy-efficient, high-performance, and universal accelerator interfaces to sustain the ever-increasing demand for scalable and ubiquitous computing processing power. Application domains like high performance computing and machine learning now process data sets of terabytes in size, requiring increasing numbers of processing and memory resources. This is at the expense of very high-power consumption due to bottlenecks in the electrical interconnections between processing units. This project aims to significantly reduce the communication energy and latency by developing novel technologies in silicon photonic reconfigurable interconnects. These reconfigurable interconnects will optimally adapt the communication bandwidth and interconnection topology as data flow patterns change for specific application workloads. The consortium achieved the following key milestones in Phase I: (a) fabrication, packaging and testing of an 8-port 16 wavelength reconfigurable all-to-all silicon photonic fabric enabling bandwidth and topology reconfiguration among interconnected nodes; (b) fabrication and testing of low-loss and low-crosstalk integrated optical multiplexers and grating structures for multi-wavelength comb sources; (c) fabrication, packaging and system integration of silicon photonic transceivers bonded with high-speed electronic drivers; (d) assembly of a prototype accelerator board for preliminary system testing with all the components fabricated above. For Phase II project, the consortium will build upon the milestones achieved in the Phase I project to deliver the following key results: (a) 32-wavelength laser with 100GHz spacing; (b) packaged 16-port 32 wavelength reconfigurable all-to-all silicon photonic fabric with electrical control plane for driving the topology and bandwidth reconfiguration between the interconnected nodes; (c) system integration and assembly of accelerator linecards using multi-wavelength electro-optic transceivers and heterogeneous processors; (d) final system demonstration of up to sixteen accelerator linecards interconnected through the fabricated 16-port reconfigurable photonic fabric. The successful completion of this project will lead to significant improvements in energy and performance of large-scale data centers and high- performance computing systems, paving the way for the wide-spread use of emerging artificial intelligence applications which heavily rely on application-specific accelerator units."

        "Abstract": "Synchrotron light sources and x-ray free electron lasers are generating shorter pulses with more intense light than ever before possible. The capabilities of these new sources grant unprecedented access into the workings of the natural world. X-ray scattering experiments are among the most common and critical types of experiments conducted in the light source community today. X-ray detectors, as they currently stand, cannot accommodate the large dynamic range of collected x-rays in modern scattering experiments. This capability gap in the detector market leaves scientists unable to answer fundamental research questions. The proposed program will advance the development of a novel wide dynamic range x-ray mixed-mode pixel array detector conceived at a national laboratory. This mixed-mode detector has demonstrated single x-ray sensitivity with a dynamic range of greater than 108 photons per second per pixel with a read noise of 0.16 photons. The technology has evolved to the commercial prototype phase and the proposed program will use knowledge gathered in early stages to improve and expand upon it. Phase I leveraged the laboratory research and development at the national laboratory to initiate a technology transfer of the mixed-mode pixel array detector. This phase resulted in a conceptual design for a commercial prototype, Phase II resulted in the manufacturing of the prototype detector. Phase II also initiated laboratory and beamline characterization testing of the prototype. The primary objective of the proposed program is to further test the current 512x512 pixel commercial prototype for performance and further produce a one-megapixel detector. Electrical, mechanical, and software components will be validated and improved throughout the project with user feedback. Importantly, each commercial prototype manufactured under this work will be tested at a synchrotron. A robust and commercially supported detector available in large sizes, with the current proven performance specifications will enable x-ray scattering without the need to introduce structured semitransparent beam stops or phase diffusers, which is not possible with today\u2019s commercial detectors. The one-megapixel detector in particular will enable wide angle experiments not previously accessible. This will lead to new higher resolution, and sharper contrast diffraction patterns and higher resolution structure determination. These advances will provide the user community with unparalleled resolution of data sets with even larger dynamic ranges, drastically improve scientist\u2019s ability to collect data, and allow greater insight into materials."

        "Abstract": "Novel, high performance semiconductor detectors are needed for future dark matter and dark energy exploration projects initiated by the Department of Energy, Office of High Energy Physics. In-situ measurement of minority carrier recombination lifetime and lifetime distribution along entire wafer\/brick\/ingot surfaces are required to evaluate the semiconductor materials used for detector fabrication and to optimize the detector fabrication processing procedures. In response to the DOE\u2019s requirements, EPIR proposes to fabricate and deliver a minority carrier lifetime mapping system that will measure the carrier recombination lifetime and two-dimensional lifetime distributions. We plan to use a pulse semiconductor laser with rise\/decay time less than 0.5ns as excitation source and a long- wavelength-infrared (LWIR) laser as a probe light. The laser pulse will generate the excess carriers that will lead to increased free carrier absorption, proportional to the excess carrier concentration. Free carrier absorption decay will be detected using a fast (2 GHz bandwidth) LWIR HgCdTe detector. EPIR will fabricate the LWIR detector using in-house grown HgCdTe material and detector fabrication technology. High speed analog to digital convertor boards will be used to digitalize the time-dependent signal. A two-dimensional scanner will be built for mapping and scanning measurements up to 15 inch \u00d7 19 inch, sufficient for any large area semiconductor wafers. With further maturation of the measurement system and technology, our proposed system can also be integrated in other semiconductor material evaluation and device fabrication lines, including the ones used for radiation\/infrared detectors and light emission devices"

        "Abstract": "With the accelerator applications in many areas demanding higher fluxes of particles and radiation, there are increasing requirements on developing high average power, high peak power, large-aperture low-loss Faraday isolators capable of handling kW-class, sub-picosecond ultrafast laser systems at either Yb or Tm wavelength. Tremendous effort has been made in many DOE national labs like Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to attain the pulse energy toward Joule level with repetition rates at and beyond kHz. The reliable operation of optical components like isolator becomes extremely important in building kilowatt-class ultrafast laser systems. Raytum Photonics proposes an innovative KW class high power isolator platform based on terbium gallium garnet (TGG) crystal for Yb wavelength and Bismuth iron garnet (BIG) for Tm wavelength, which features: Liquid cooled isolator outer case, serving both as the frame of the isolator body as well as heat sink to dissipate the heat from the optical elements and light of the rejected polarization. Specially coated Brewster plates are used as both input or output polarizer, being able to handle power density better than 20kW\/cm2 (CW) and 2GW\/cm2 (Pulsed) respectively. Built-in rejected light trapper removed the need for escape window for easier layout of laser system. Composite Neodymium rare earth magnets formation for large aperture and uniform field. Built-in effective heat dissipation path from inner rotator material to isolator case. Introduction of compensator for the thermal lensing effect. A mean to improve the temperature uniformity at the boundary condition of the rotator materials, therefore to minimize the heat induced birefringence. Including optical rotator (such as quartz rotator) to compensate for wavelength dependency of the Faraday rotator for the wide isolation bandwidth which is desirable for the ultrafast laser operation. Dual rotator stage. We identify that facets of the rotator material are the most vulnerable area exposed to high laser power density. For both TGG and BIG rotator, we propose an innovative defect-free antireflection coating (AR) prepared by Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) technique to serve for facet passivation &amp; protection. During the Phase I, we are going to establish numerical model to analyze the isolation, insertion loss, heat dissipation pattern and magnetic field. The model will become a tool for detailed isolator design and failure analysis, design and build key components, demonstrating the components and assembled unit can handle higher power level up to 3KW (CW) by extrapolating experimental data in lab. We will also demonstrate the system can handle up to 100KW by scaling up the beam size and design refinement. During the Phase 2, we are going to deliver specs conforming units for both Yb and Tm wavelength as well as establish a manufacturing process of building the high power isolators in volume. All development work will conduct in Raytum Photonics facility. We are also going to collaborate with Lawrence Berkeley National Lab to have a preliminary test with the isolator we develop in Raytum Photonics facility."

        "Abstract": "In this project, we seek to advance high intensity laser technologies of interest to laser plasma acceleration (LPA) of electrons, as well as for applications of laser-accelerated electrons for light source applications including Inverse Compton Scattering gamma sources and betatron x-ray sources. Past experience in laser science has proven that progress in understanding and optimizing any application is greatly accelerated when the process can be implemented with high repetition- rate kHz lasers: this not-only increases the average power and data acquisition rate, but also allows data acquisition at frequencies well above the \u201c1\/f noise\u201d spectrum typical of experimental applications, allowing for faster optimization. Furthermore, the more-interactive nature of experimentation facilitates the discovery of new regions of parameter space and new phenomena. To-date, few experiments have made use of kHz lasers for laser plasma acceleration, because of the very high peak power requirement to accelerate electrons to relativistic energies of ~25-100 MeV, while maintaining the narrow energy spread necessary for the majority of applications. However, several recent developments have made such a prospect both interesting and feasible. Several groups have used very short-duration, sub-TW pulses to accelerate electrons to few-MeV energy with broad spectral bandwidth\u2014proving that LPA at kHz repetition rates is possible. Also, several experiments done with lower rep-rate lasers have demonstrated that low energy spread electron beams in the range of 30-100 MeV can be generated using pulses of few-TW peak power. The development of a kHz repetition-rate, multi-TW laser will make it possible to access this parameter range\u2014and is a feasible prospect. In the past, KMLabs has delivered ~ 1 TW\/ 1 kHz lasers to customers; but to-date the laser technology has not as-yet reached any known physical limit. In this project, we plan to explore in Phase I, and implement in Phase II, the first, to our knowledge, multi-TW kHz repetition-rate laser. Our goal will be to demonstrate near-diffraction- limited focusability, a 15-20 fs pulse duration, a peak focused intensity consistent with all laser parameters, and a laser that can relaibly operate 24\/7 without drift in parameters. This performance is possible using advanced pulse shaping and beam characterization methods, as well as optimized cryogenic cooling in Ti:sapphire amplifiers. To keep within the budget parameters of Phase II, we will make use of existing equipment at KMLabs\u2014with the goal of implementing a sub-scale demonstration, and then collaborating with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to implement the full system (100 mJ, 1 kHz,"

The modular design concept divides the camera into three modules that can be interchanged to accommodate a variety of missions. The adaptability of the modular concept benefits lower cost, improve reliability, and decrease schedule and risk. The ASC modular LiDAR design allows for an interchangeable optics module assembly (OMA) that can be designed with a mission specific Field of View (FOV) and mission specific optics. The laser module assembly (LMA) is a module that can be mission configurable\/selectable. Operating in a step-stare method the LiDAR can quickly cover the Field of Regard (FOR) providing real-time data at a 10Hz rate. The mechanical structural and thermal system is designed will have a common interface to support multiple laser module types. The LiDAR will operate as a cued sensor, pointed to objects of interest or locations of interest to collect data for purposes of combat identification. Our state-of-the-art LiDAR will be incorporated into the AgilePod\u00c2\u00ae with an open system architecture suitable for group IV and V RPAs. The ASC modular concept will help develop a plug and play LiDAR capability using agile manufacturing concepts into the AgilePod\u00c2\u00ae."

        "Abstract": "As the fusion science research advances towards the demonstration of practical reactors for commercial adoption there is a growing need to develop diagnostic systems for monitoring various plasma parameters in real time for control and shaping of the plasma density and profile. Recent, experiments have demonstrated the potential of a high-k Scattering system for studying turbulence physics studies by providing a measurement of the k\u03b8-spectrum of both electron temperature gradient (ETG) and ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes. Currently, a large and bulky Far Infrared (FIR) laser system is in use at the National Spherical Torus Experiment - Upgrade (NSTX-U) for such experiments. Also, the receiver systems use multiple solid-state sources to work as local oscillators for the receiver bank. The mixers are operated at higher harmonics of the local oscillator due to limited power available at 693 GHz. We propose to develop a compact broadband TWT at 693 GHz providing &gt;100 mW of power to work as a local oscillator for a bank of receivers. The mixers can operate at fundamental mode providing higher conversion efficiency. Furthermore, this TWT can also be used on the transmitter side of the diagnostic to eliminate the need for a large far infrared laser system in the high-k scattering diagnostic. The TWT can also enable the creation of the much-needed reflectometer diagnostic to monitor divertor performance in a burning plasma machine. This technology can be extended to any frequency in the 1 THz range using currently available fabrication techniques and hence have wide applicability in different fusion reactors operating over a range of plasma density and magnetic field. The development of such a source will be essential for real time plasma monitoring and reflectometry in the divertor region in a commercial reactor. In the short term, such receivers will advance further development of this technique and methods at experiments such as the National Spherical Torus Experiment - Upgrade (NSTX-U). The proposed TWT technology can also be used for Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) enhanced Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for structure determination of proteins for drug development."

        "Abstract": "The deployment of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) to nuclear-related applications became acceler- ated after the 2011 Fukushima accident. In the US, this effort is administered by the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) under a Congressionally-mandated Accident-Tolerant Fuel (ATF) program. This effort still requires several technical advancements to achieve widespread use in nuclear reactor structures and fuel cladding. Silicon carbide (SiC), as part of a SiC matrix-SiC fiber system, is recognized as the primary material option to achieve the ATF goals, but present-day manufacturing presents multiple performance issues for nuclear fuel com- ponent manufacturers. These performance shortcomings include strength and thermal conductivity degradations due to manufacturing-induced damage and the environmental response of the material in nuclear environment. Free Form Fibers (FFF) proposes a novel approach to fabricate a non-woven fiber architecture for Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs) using its additive manufacturing-based Rapid Laser-Induced Chemical Vapor Deposition (R- LCVD) technology, which would eliminate the need for fiber weaving and also open an opportunity to create innova- tive metal matrix composite-ceramic matrix composite (MMC-CMC) hybrid structures. This non-woven design, termed micro trellises, would allow for several important technical advances needed to achieve the DOE and nuclear industry&apos;s goal for safe, high efficiency fuel designs. The non-woven architecture significantly reduces the residual porosity and increases the possible fiber volume fraction loading, while also curtailing manufacturing induced defects. These features minimize the necessary CMC component thickness, providing positive benefits to the bulk thermal conductivity, component weight reduction, and easier and quicker matrix formation via vapor infiltration. The program presented by FFF in this proposal aims to demonstrate the viability of fabricating metal-CMC hybrid cladding on the basis of micro trellis design. FFF has extensive capabilities to form SiC fiber arrays, trellis-like posts on substrates as well as coat fibers and posts with interface coating materials. FFF also introduces a novel approach to vapor infiltration of the matrix designed to minimize damage the underlying substrate to create a CMC component, or a MMC-CMC component. Component-level properties like thermal conductivity will be evaluated as well as more fundamental hydrothermal corrosion in nuclear reactor and mechanical properties of the trellis structures. The development of FFF&apos;s micro trellis will enable several needed technical advances for CMC technology, impact- ing a wide range of applications including the nuclear power, aviation, aerospace and gas turbines. One of the most significant improvements will be the reduction in overall CMC manufacturing economic costs for nuclear fuel reactor components such as cladding."

        "Abstract": "Measuring the paths and positions of subatomicparticles is at the core of high energy physics (HEP) research. Such measurements require detectors of extraordinary speed and resolution, and electrical components must endure extremes of temperature, electromagneticfields, and radiation. To support the high luminosity upgrades at ATLAS and CMS, both pixel size reduction, which increases resolution, and &quot;thinning&quot; of the substrate, which improves high-energy radiation resistance are critical. Many detectors that are critical to HEP research would benefit from atechnology that allows low- temperature, CMOS compatible annealing of dopants and defects in semiconductors. Someexamples include: monolithic CMOS sensors forvertex and tracking systems; thin diode array sensors forhybrid detectors; entrance windows on CCDs and APSs forcosmology, and defect removal in CCDs and APSs. To ensure a productive application to the particle physics community, acost effectivealternativeto traditional radiation and laser based heat transfer is being proposed. A newlydeveloped capacitive induction annealing (CIA) system allows forselective heating of dopants in silicon. Through interfacial polarization mechanism the dopants becomepolarized in the capacitive electrical field, allowing them to become selectively activated while the bulk silicon temperature remains at lowertemperatures. The result is dopant activation with negligible dopant diffusion, high activation efficiency of dopants (B\/P\/As) with no damage to the CMOS devices on the front side, even with the presence of metals. CIA system should prove to be an efficient way to achieve shallow entrance windows in silicon sensors without the use of expensiveand complex process flows associated with using silicon-on-insulator(SOI) wafers. Phase 2 objectives are to demonstrate post-processed junctions, on monolithic CMOS sensors, demonstrating good diode IV and dark current characteristi cs, as well as radiation sensing, using CIA for backside junction post-process. We will be investigating new types of sensormaterials, such as germanium, SiC and diamond substrates, at different wafersizes and thicknesses to optimize activation efficiency and device performance using Capacitive Inductive Annealing (CIA). We will perform demos, for each developed sensorapplication, on our CIA chamberinstalled at DSG\u2019s lab to optimize wafer uniformity and maximize throughput with the final objective to design, build and test a first article production system to support state-of-the art back-side CMOS image sensors (CIS) manufacturing. Partnering with global leaders in semiconductorfabrication, CIA technology has demonstrated, on vertical structures (3DNAND), a 2X improvement in mobility and on 7nm FinFETstructures, with 10:1 aspect ratio, uniform 3D densification of dielectrics. CIA technology willhelp drive furtherminimization of integrated circuits in all semiconductorsectors (imagesensors, logic, power and memory)."

        "Abstract": "HARPOON (High Access Raman Probe with Onboard Optical Numerization) is a next-generation ultra-compact laser Raman Spectrometer equipped with multiplexed fiber optic sensing points. HARPOONrsquo;s superior performance meets the top-level scientific requirements of multiple planetary missions to the inner and outer Solar System.HARPOON boasts an innovative combination of adaptive spatial coding optics and detector that enables unique measurements: in-situ chemical identification and sub-ppb quantitation of complex organic compounds, including pre-biotic compounds (e.g. amino acids); biomolecules (organic biomarkers such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acid polymers); minerals; salts; volatiles.HARPOON has five science objectives traceable to observational requests of high-priority mission objectives and specific science investigations. HARPOON informs these five science objectives by performing high-resolution, high-sensitivity quantitative analyses of samples via an innovative approach to Raman spectroscopy. Raman is probably the most powerful tool available for in-situ, non-invasive molecular and mineralogical characterizations. Based on the inelastic scattering of light, the Raman technique identifies molecular species and their chemical and structural nature. HARPOON changes paradigm in in-situ planetary Raman exploration: it enhances the sensitivity of Raman intruments by several orders of magnitude.Our strategies for maximizing the likelihood of mission infusion are: cost-effective scheme, versatile design, and operational flexibility. This makes HARPOON suitable for multiple spacecraft configurations. The use of remote fiber optic sensing: (1) enables the placement of multiple Raman heads both external and internal to the spacecraft; (2) allows to concurrently or sequentially analyze different types of samples (non-contact and contact; solid and liquid); and (3) provides flexibility to couple Raman analysis to other analytical tools."

        "Abstract": "DiSCO (Dual in-situ Spectroscopy and COring) is an innovative arm-mounted instrument for acquiring and analyzing planetary subsurface materials. The instrument extracts 5 times; 1 cm cores, and immediately performs in-situ, time-resolved, coregistered imaging and spectroscopic mapping at high resolution ndash; 10 micro;m and 50 micro;m, respectively. The significant attribute of our technology is the ability to focus on a specific layer or location on the core surface ndash; something that none of the previous, current, or even future surface missions have capability to do. The Mars Exploration Rovers clearly illustrated the need for such a capability by exposing rock surface and identifying round nodules. Unfortunately, the arm mounted instruments were unable to analyze the nodules themselves, but rather took an lsquo;averagersquo; of the area.DiSCOnbsp;is the first instrument that boasts integrated drilling\/coring\/caching, imaging, and laser spectroscopic mapping systems. DiSCO integrates a combined fiber-based optical imaging, laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS), laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), and laser-induced native fluorescence (LINF) system into an SBIR-funded, demonstrated drilling and coring platform.DiSCO delivers three game-changing advantages in lander\/rover based planetary exploration: a) unprecedented analytical capabilities ndash; in-situ, coregistered high-resolution imaging and LRS+LIBS+LINF core mapping, b) minimization of the resources and complexity required to perform subsurface science analyses ndash; no need for core processing and delivery systems and robotic arm movement between the rock and an instrument onboard of the rover, and c) possibility for novel mission architectures ndash; coring + analysis + caching capabilities are offered within a single, highly modular arm-mounted instrument."

        "Abstract": "Long range optical communications using Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors (SNSPDs) is a new and promising technology for deep spacecraft communications. SNSPDs are planned for use in future NASA space-to-ground laser communication. In the current state of the art, the clock rates are limited in part by the timing jitter of the SNSPD. Improving the timing jitter of SNSPDs results in higher clock rates, higher data rates and longer ranges. Currently timing jitters of 2.7pS have been demonstrated in laboratory research. The Phase 1 SBIR Project focused on the feasibility of a low power, low noise cryogenic differential amplifier. It is expected that integrating the amplifier with the SNSPD will lower the timing jitter to less than 1pS, allowingnbsp;higher data rates and longer ranges without requiring additional mass and power on a spacecraft. Higher data rates will also result in higher resolution images received from space probes. The successful completion of Phase 1 resulted in the delivery of a differential amplifier prototype for integration and testing with a SNSPD. The delivered amplifier exhibits 20db of gain, 5K noise temperature with 2.0mW of power dissipation. The next phase towards a long-range communication system is to fabricate a multi-channel MMIC and construct a 64channel receiver. A 64 channel receive allows 64 digital bits of information. The large number of digital bits are necessary for high speed communications and high-resolution images. The scope of the Phase 2 research will focus on miniaturization of the differential amplifier and design of the 64channel receiver.nbsp; Delivery of the receiver will push the efforts for a longer-range optical communications system.nbsp;"

        "Abstract": "This proposal innovates an ultrafast laser welding (UFLW) system and processes that provide epoxy-free bonding of optical and mechanical components suitable for lidar sources in the space environment. This proposal responds to SBIR subtopic S1.01 Lidar Remote Sensing Technologies, aiming at improving instrumentsrsquo; compactness, reliability, lifetime, and long-term performance. It will develop the UFLW technology from the theoretical and experimental standpoints with three objectives: (I) Theoretically investigate the physical mechanism of UFLW to predict weld geometry and thermal stress. (II)Experimentally investigate the impact of focusing conditions and inter-substrate gap height on weld geometry and bond strength. (III) Demonstrate effective UFLW of glass-to-glass\/crystal and glass\/crystal to metal. The simulations on ultrafast laser propagation, nonlinear absorption, plasma generation, heat accumulation, and melt zone formation will be conducted, predicting welding geometry. The effect of focusing conditions, scanning speed, and gap height on weld geometry and bond strength will be experimentally investigated. Optimum processing parameters for bonding the proposed glass\/metal\/crystal materials will be determined. Bond strength and weld geometry will be characterized and reported. UFLW will enable monolithic lasers and increase the integrity and durability of space-borne instruments. It will also benefit commercial sensors and advance very high Speed datacom amp; communications links via advanced electronics\/photonics integration. The success of this project has high potential to enable the US to become the international leader of the emerging digital manufacturing sector enabled by ultrafast lasers. The offeror, Aktiwave LLC, is exceptionally well aligned with the goals and aspirations of the SBIR program, possessing leading expertise and capability in lasers and ultrafast-laser-based welding, polishing and structuring of optical materials."

        "Abstract": "Whether using meltprobes, mechanical drills, or hybrid approaches, Europa ice penetration systemsnbsp;will likely utilize tether to provide data communication to the lander, and possibly power from it.nbsp; Our innovation, Pulsed Waveguide Latency Spectral Receptor, PWLSR, leverages such tethered approaches to ice penetration. Adding a single dispersive optical fiber cable, PWLSR turns the tether into a spectrometer that obtains time-correlated in-situ spectroscopy information aboard Europa iceprobes. PWLSR is a cost-effective way to enhance the science return of subsurface Europa missions: it adds just 2 kg and 2,000 cc to the iceprobe and a 0.2 mm fiber cable to the tether, and returns compositional information of the subsurface as the iceprobe advances through the ice.PWLSRnbsp;focuses laser light into the the ice, collects scattered and re-emitted photons, and launches them into a dispersive optical fiber integrated into the tether connecting iceprobe and lander. The fiber is terminated in a retroflector at the surface end of the tether which reflects light back into the fiber. Photons return to the iceprobe, where they are routed into a detector and analyzed. Results are compressed and transmitted to lander using tethered and\/or free-space communication system.nbsp; PWLSR fiber cable can be split into several segments, linked by fiber-optic connectors. This way, it can be housed into several spool bays that can be sequentially left behind in the ice once a spool is depleted.PWLSR combines, for the first time, deep subsurface access and laser spectroscopy to build a scientific instrument that addresses scientific objectives of future landed science missions to Ocean Worlds, particularly Europa.nbsp;nbsp;Developing PWLSR is a key, risk-reducing effort that paves the way for maturation of the instrument towards flight while also stimulating technological innovation both for commercial and federal use beyond planetary exploration."

Each fiber will feed into a multichannel spectrometer (spectrograph) which can take all the spectra in a single acquisition.nbsp; This way, spectra at all scattering angles can be collected simultaneously, which greatly reduces the overall measurement time. In additional to the much faster speed, the proposed scheme also offers the following advantages over the current state of the art instrument design:nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; 1) There will be no moving parts outside of the main instrument housing, which makes it easier to be sealed, more robust and portable;\nnbsp;nbsp;nbsp; 2) Instead of collecting scattered light at different points along the laser beam, the proposed design looks at the same small volume of water.\nnbsp;nbsp;nbsp; 3) Because the optical path lengths for all scattering angles are the same in the proposed new instrumentnbsp; The overall simple and symmetric geometry (e.g. the identical optical path lengths at different angles) will make calibration easier and improve accuracy.nbsp;"

        "Abstract": "Tribo Flow Separations, LLC proposes a novel method for measuring nitrogen ground state densities and rotational temperatures of molecular nitrogen in the free stream of arcjet ground testing facilities through emission spectroscopy measurements. Knowlede of these quantities will reduce uncertainties in the knowledge of local specific enthalpy which, in turn, is the defining quantity for the determination of heat flux to a surface of a probe or sample. In comparison with current methods, like Two Photon Laser Absorption Fluorescence, the proposed approach is cheaper than currently-used approaches by orders of magnitude, far easier to conduct and can be accomplished without interfering with other goals of testing; this aspect is of particular importance since no additional testing is required which saves testing costs. This new, unique method can be run as a standard diagnostic method without disrupting regular test schedules. It therefore provides the opportunity of monitoring test conditions very efficiently without relying on the stability of predefined test conditions, which in the end increases the reliability of the whole test campaign. Within Phase I, a single-channel, miniaturized spectrometer will be developed, constructed and used for its capability to measure nitrogen atom ground state densities and nitrogen molecule rotational temperatures. The foundational design of a multi-channel version will also be developed and then built, installed and tested at a NASA facility in Phase II."

        "Abstract": "Laser interferometers are the state of the art for characterizing large telescope optics, manufacturing custom optics, aspheres, freeform optics, and for semiconductor wafer characterization. For test optics with large surface errors, a reference optic and\/or a custom computer-generated hologram (CGH) can be used to bring the errors within the interferometerrsquo;s range.However, many situations result in large departures from reference optics. Thermal amp; gravity sag effects in large optics can cause significant deviations, only some of which may be predictable. Test optics in semiconductor manufacturing may include sharp, irregular steps of many waves. In the early stages of optics polishing, departures from reference can be extreme. Custom optics, including asphere and freeform, can deviate hugely from spherical, and for these a custom CGH (with a typical lead time of 6 months and cost of $10k) is not always economical.We propose to extend the range of an interferometer by providing gt; 50 waves of programmable phase control using a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM). In addition to extending the range of phase errors that can be characterized, the SLM interferometer can apply additional arbitrary phase.In Phase I we will upgrade a prototype SLM interferometer that we previously used to demonstrate nulling and programmable phase control. Phase I will focus on improving interferometer speed, calibration, and stability, and quantifying performance through the following technical objectives:Design for interferometer upgrade with polarization cameraConstruction of the SLM interferometerImplementation of single-shot phase shifting interferometry (PSI)2D Phase\/voltage SLM calibrationCharacterizing range and accuracyDemonstrating key applicationsDelivery amp; demonstration of Phase I prototypenbsp;In Phase II BNS will incorporate an upgraded 1536x1536 pixel MacroSLM into a commercial interferometer and demonstrate its performance in typical use cases.nbsp;"

        "Abstract": "Speckodyne Corp. in collaboration with Plasma TEC, Inc. and Princeton University proposes to develop a novel, multifunctional optical diagnostic platform for kilohertz rate, non-intrusive, quantitative 1D and 2D imaging of relevant gas parameters in arc driven and other high enthalpy ground testing facilities. The platform implements and integrates state-of-the art optical diagnostic techniques that are enabled by femtosecond-based nonlinear optics: hybrid picosecond\/femtosecond Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) and Two-photon Absorption Laser induced Fluorescence (TALIF). The hybrid CARS provides single shot point and line measurements of molecular species concentrations and state populations, as well as rotational and vibrational temperatures, whereas the TALIF provides line and planar measurements of atomic oxygen, nitrogen, argon and other atomic species concentrations. Extending the TALIF to the measurement of velocity profiles will also be considered based on atomic fluorescence Femtosecond Laser Electronic Excitation Tagging (FLEET). Both FLEET and hybrid CARS were recently demonstrated in Mach 10 to 18 in nitrogen flow at AEDC Tunnel 9 in Maryland by the Plasma TEC-Speckodyne team. The proposed platform is powered by a single kilohertz-rate femtosecond laser and incorporates a high-speed imaging system. The system architectural strategy is designed to meet transportability requirements and reliable operation in the harsh environment of NASArsquo;s large-scale ground test and evaluation facilities. The completion of the Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of this concept of measuring dissociation fraction, species, nonequilibrium and temperature at kHz rate over the wide range of operational conditions characterizing high-enthalpy wind tunnel flows. The development of the system requirements and specification will support the next-phase effort focused on prototype development, implementation and testing at NASArsquo;s ground-based facilities."

        "Abstract": "We offer several innovations in the joining of various elements in hollow cathodes and the surrounding structures. These replace the more expensive, less compact, brazing technology and mechanical capture currently used. The proposed techniques include welding 1) molybdenum to molybdenum; 2) molybdenum and molybdenum alloys to porous tungsten; 3) molybdenum to stainless steel; 4) molybdenum to kovar; 5) a new potted tungsten heater to cathodes and supports; and 6) alternative materials such as niobium and hafnium. All of these weld processes allow automated production.nbsp;E beam has over 30 yearsrsquo; experience developing new, innovative cathode structures. It is the leader in cathode miniaturization. Precision laser and resistance welding is essential for these structures. E beam is the only company that can reliably weld impregnated cathodes to base metals.nbsp;The secret to successful welding of disparate refractories is the choice of interface materials and the allowance for mismatches in the coefficient of thermal expansion. We routinely employ TIG, resistance, and laser welding in cathode production, and have done ebeam welding.nbsp;In addition to conventional hollow cathodes, we plan to apply the new joining techniques to scandate hollow cathodes, hollow reservoir cathodes, and planar micro-thruster cathodes. The proposed innovations will improve and lower the cost of conventional hollow cathodes. A planar 0.050-inch diameter planar scandate cathode using heater power of only half a watt is able to produce over one ampere of discharge current."

        "Abstract": "This SBIR project is to develop a new type of high-speed optical data link that can operate with high efficiency and reliability to enable optical data speeds that are much greater than currently possible. The optical data link will use a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) with a new type of cavity that eliminates internal strain and reduces the internal device temperature to operate with very high reliability under bias conditions needed for high speed. The currently used VCSELs in for example NASArsquo;s SpaceFibre are limited to 3-6.125 Gbps mainly due to reliability problems for bias currents needed to reach higher speeds. When reliability constraints are lessened for use in data centers for example, the same VCSEL technology used for data centers can produce 25 Gbps, with 50 Gbps VCSEL-based data links now under development. The VCSEL technology proposed for this project uses a new type of laser cavity that can be scaled smaller and operate with higher reliability than existing technology, and has already been shown to operate with very high reliability under extreme conditions exceeding that possible using commercially available VCSELs. The SBIR Phase I project will develop the new laser device for direct insertion into high quality transceiver packages being manufactured for space platforms. nbsp;A Phase II effort will characterize the optical transceiver to develop a prototype that can be supplied to government laboratories and tested on various platforms. The new laser technology can be manufactured with a much smaller laser cavity than has been possible before, to improve the optical link efficiency by reducing bit energy. sdPhotonics will partner with a transceiver manufacture and utilize growth and fabrication foundries to develop a commercial supply of the new laser technology for use in high speed optical data networks for harsh environments."

Recent GSF-LIDAR improvements have focused on WFOV and IFOV performance using smaller pixels and larger focal plane array formats. However, smaller pixels degrade LIDAR range performance. Increasing range performance using higher energy lasers is problematic due to the severe size, weight, and power penalties. These SWAP penalties can be avoided by improving the LIDAR detector photo-electrical gain. Range performance is proportional to the square-root of detector photo-optical gain. Existing GSF-LIDARs use InGaAs APD technology. The effective photo-optical gain is the product of the intrinsic quantum efficiency. Typical linear mode InGaAs APD gains range from 1 to 10.nbsp; Recent advancements in AlxIn1-x AsySb1-y indicate that linear mode photo-optical gains greater than 100 can be achieved with minimal noise degradation. Thus GSF-LIDAR imaging \/ ranging detectors with improved WFOV, IFOV, and range 1.7X range performance with no additional laser energy requirement. ASC is proposing to develop an AlxIn1-x AsySb1-y detector design optimized for 1064nm operation. In addition, ASC is planning to perform performance measurements on existing AlxIn1-x AsySb1-y 100um single element APDs. Using this information, the focus of the Phase II program is fabricate and evaluate the ranging \/imaging 32x32 element GSF-LIDAR focal plane test chip."

        "Abstract": "Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies have reached promising heights in the recent years while offering several advantages over traditional manufacturing methods, especially in the case of aerospace parts and in-space manufacturing. Whereas the advancements in wire feed metal AM are promising for recently ramped up LEO and deep space efforts of NASA (Artemis, OSAM) and private space agencies, the technology still lacks build reliability which would have ensured a defect free part with correct form-factor the first time without needing post-build quality assurance or in the worst case, part rejection. Thus, it is significant for a wire feed metal AM system to have the ability of in-situ, layer-by-layer build quality assurance by maintaining partsrsquo; dimensional accuracy and defect-free metal deposition. This Phase I effort presents a novel approach to solve the problem by targeting to detect, identify and correct optically detectable weld surface defects such as porosity, hot-cracking and lack of fusion. The first innovation is a camera vision-based layer-by-layer weld-surface defect identification system for wire feed AM process. The camera is mounted on an articulated robot for autonomous scanning of every single layer of deposited metal. A Convolutional Neural Network type Deep Learning-based software is utilized to aid defect identification and sending an output to the robot for a ldquo;Gordquo;\/rdquo;No-Gordquo; decision over continuing deposit of subsequent layers. The second innovation is an automated laser displacement sensor for real-time measurement of part dimensions and auto-correction of robot path to compensate for discrepancies in metal deposition that can potentially result in parts with dimensional defects. The proposed innovations are targeted toward filling the gaps of real time dimensional and weld-surface defect detection, identification and correction for wire-feed metal AM processes."

        "Abstract": "Several presentations were given at NASArsquo;s 2019 Mirror Tech Days that highlighted the shortcomings of current mirror-fabrication technologies, particularly as they relate to demanding missions such as LUVOIR and HabEx.nbsp; Many of the mirror deficiencies, such as areal density, surface figure error, stiffness, and surface figure changes over temperature, can be traced ndash; either directly or indirectly ndash; to mirror lightweighting.nbsp; Current lightweighting processes result in pockets in the rear-side of the mirror that have abrupt stress-concentrating corners, poor front-rear symmetry, and poor material allocation in the webbing.nbsp; The proposed laser machining process allows for the fabrication of cavities within a mirror that preserves front-rear symmetry, has no corners, and has a near ideal allocation of material within the webbing.The novel laser machining process utilizes a CO2 laser in an ablation regimen in which the focused beam strikes below the surface of the workpiece from the side (as opposed to the front or rear as is commonly done).nbsp; Material between the focused beam and the surface is ejected by the shockwave produced by the laserrsquo;s pulse, greatly increasing the amount of material removed for each pulse.nbsp; Further, the focused laser beam can be split in two and laterally separated; when pulsed the shockwave ndash; and material removal ndash; can bridge the gap between the focal spots and increase the removal rate further.nbsp; We project that material removal rates exceeding 80 cubic millimeters per second are possible."

        "Abstract": "The EPA has identified a need for new methods and instrumentation to characterize size, shape, and composition of microplastics, especially in the size range of 1 \u00b5m \u2013 1 mm. To meet the needs identified by EPA, we propose development of a portable sensor for improved microplastic sampling and characterization useable at remote measurement sites or fixed installations. The sensor would be connected to water sampling lines placed in regions where microplastic characterization is desired.\nParticulates in the size range 10 \u00b5m \u2013 1 mm filtered from the water stream onto a micro-mesh metal substrate will be probed using high-performance infrared laser hyperspectral imaging\/microscopy, based on swept-external cavity quantum cascade lasers. This powerful spectroscopic imaging technique will measure size and shape of any particles collected from the microscope images, while at the same time determining the chemical composition via infrared spectroscopic analysis. A wide range of pure and weathered polymer\/plastic materials will be identifiable using this technique and distinguished from inorganic particles or biological materials. By automating sample collection, measurement, and analysis, while eliminating the costly and labor-intensive steps of sample purification and cleaning, the sensor will operate continuously and autonomously. This operation mode will allow large volumes of data to be collected for microplastic characterization at multiple sites, as is needed to improve the understanding of the full effects of microplastics on the environment and human health. The technology will be immediately usable by researchers at academic institutions or government research laboratories to improve quality and quantity of microplastic data. In the future, these sensors would be installed in fixed locations at industrial sites, municipal water supplies, or other areas at high risk for microplastic contamination, ultimately allowing online monitoring for safety or regulatory purposes. The technology developed may also be applied to new markets where particle characterization is required, such as environmental monitoring or detection of explosives."

        "Abstract": "To monitor the freshness of fresh produce in storage and during transportation, we propose using a gas sensor based on swept\u0081]wavelength broadly tunable external cavity quantum cascade lasers (EQCCLs).These sensors detect, identify, and quantify multiple chemical species in the airspace near the sensor continuously and in real\u0081]time, with part\u0081]per\u0081]billion level sensitivity. The sensors will monitor the air in food storage areas for key gases including ethylene, alcohols, ketones, acetates, amines, and more produced by vegetables and fruits as they ripen and before they spoil. The detection of ethylene in food storage facilities is critical as it is emitted naturally during ripening and can also accelerate the ripening process if allowed to accumulate. However, although ethylene is an indicator of ripening for climacteric fruits and vegetables, it is not universal for all produce and is not directly an indicator of pre\u0081]spoilage.Using our proposed monitoring system, we will measure the airspace around produce in storage continuously to detect when multiple key gases reach threshold levels indicating that spoilage is imminent. We will then take mitigating steps to (1) notify the operators of the storage facility to prioritize use of the produce near spoilage and (2) extend the shelf life of produce applying deep ultraviolet air sterilization to breakdown air pathogens and volatile organic compounds without changing the nutritional value of the produce.Current technologies for produce monitoring focus almost exclusively on ethylene detection. Our technology will improve on existing techniques by detecting multiple additional gases simultaneously and continuously at much lower concentrations, and by doing so will be applicable to nearly all food types to detect pre\u0081]spoilage conditions in storage. The potential market size for this technology is estimated to be &gt; $1B, assuming even a modest reduction in food waste of &gt; 1%."

This design called &quot;Growth Enhancing Mixing Spectrum&quot;(GEMS) creates eddies that generate efficient transverse fluid flow across PBR tubes usingvery low mean flow rates and thus very low input energies. We will test this mixing strategy forthe first time on growth rates and biomass yields of microalgae in several configurations ofGEMS PBRs relative to standard smooth-tube PBRs. Its physics involves the interaction of fluidflow with static alterations of tube walls that extend deep into the main pipe flow beyond theviscous region. These create unsteady three-dimensional flow separations that divert energy intocrossflows. This separation phenomenon is inherently scalable and uses no moving parts.Studies will be performed in four 10-liter GEMS PBRs to test algal productivity over a range ofparameters. We anticipate productivities approaching those in optimal laboratory cultures andsubstantially greater (~5x or more) than in best mass-scale systems. Our best 10-liter design willbe scaled to 500 liters to test productivity in a GEMS PBR ready for Phase II development andcommercialization. These GEMS systems hold game-changing potential for economic recoveryof CO2 effluents from ethanol plants power plants and other sources for foods feeds and fuelsthat will benefit agriculture and industry. We further envision deployment of soft pipe GEMSPBRs directly in farm-field furrows with no additional land requirements as added agriculturalprofit centers."

        "Abstract": "Summary\nThe purpose of the present project is to demonstrate a new type of portable analyzer and the feasibility of\nperforming multiplex immunoassays utilizing this platform technology. The multiplex capability is made possible\nby using small, electronic p-Chips. The initial proof-of-concept application will be an immunoassay determining\nthe concentration of antibodies to dengue virus (DENV) in serum or plasma samples. The assay will be\ndesigned to rapidly determine whether a patient has been previously infected with one of the four viral\nserotypes. This information is crucial as pre-existing immunity to DENV can drastically worsen disease\nprogression and ultimately disease outcome upon re-exposure to heterologous viral serotypes. The long-term\ngoal is to provide a portable assay platform for multiplex immunoassays that analyze key biomarkers for a\nvariety of diseases. The advantages of this system are rapid assay speed (turnaround time from drawing a\npatientandapos;s blood sample to the reporting of the results), minimal sample handling and low cost for both the\nanalyzer and consumables.\nThe electronic chips are laser light-activated microtransponders (andquot;p-Chipsandquot;) that are small (600 \u00b5m x 600 \u00b5m x\n100 \u00b5m), chemically inert and highly stable. p-Chips, each of which contains a unique serial number, are\nderivatized with probes, in this case antibodies to specific protein biomarkers, and then incubated with a\nsample and binding detected with fluorescent reagent(s). A key feature of p-Chips is that they are passive\ndevices that become active only when directly illuminated with pulsed light, thus enabling them to be\nindividually read while spinning in a closed, rotating tube exposed to a focused excitation laser beam. The\nreadout relies on the simultaneous determination of the intensity of fluorescence and the chip serial number\n(ID), which identifies the binding probe. Multiplex assays are constructed by placing different probes on\np-Chips within the same test tube in a manner that lends itself readily to reading dozens to hundreds of\np-Chips and reporting results in a very short period of time. The main goals of this project are to (1) build a\nprototype reader and develop software that will both control the device and analyze the data; and (2)\ndemonstrate and characterize a one-tube-one-step-no-wash immunoassay for detecting dengue virus.\nThe results for the proposed approach will be a novel system for testing the exposure of a patient, either\nrecently or in the past, to the dengue virus. The system will be composed of the portable analyzer (andquot;Cycloneandquot;)\nand the assay configured on p-Chips quantifying four serotypes of the anti-dengue Abs in serum. The system\ncan be expanded easily to include additional biomarkers of interest.Narrative\nCurrent methods for performing multiplex assays require complex and expensive instrumentation. This project\nintroduces a new type of portable analyzer and reagent scheme that will significantly reduce the complexity,\ntime and cost to perform clinical diagnostic tests in many areas, including infectious diseases; blood, heart and\nlung diseases; and cancer. The first application of this new system will be an immunoassay to detect pre-\nexisting immunity to dengue virus infection."

        "Abstract": "Project Summary\/Abstract\nThe long-term goal of our efforts is to enable identification and mapping of every molecule in a cell. Such information\nis sought in many life-science disciplines including molecular biology, pathology, proteomics and for the pharmaceutical\nindustry. It is critical information needed to underpin fundamental advances in our understanding of life processes.\nHowever, this vision will require development of a technology for efficient detection of molecules, that does not yet\nexist. Detectors for biomolecules are the foundation of analytical instruments such as mass spectrometers. We have\ndeveloped and experimentally proven new concepts that will allow us to build and commercialize a detector\ntechnology enabling this grand vision. The technology is based on a new patented approach to using superconducting\nmaterials which can record 100% of the impinging molecules, even the heaviest proteins and protein complexes.\nMethods are now available to launch biomolecules of any mass from tissue and water solutions as ions into mass\nspectrometers with high efficiency and no fragmentation or denaturing. Such soft laser-ionization methods as MALDI\n(matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization) and DIVE (desorption by impulsive vibrational excitation) open new\nopportunities for molecular analysis and mapping. We have designs for mass spectrometers that can deliver these ions\nonto a detector with very high mass resolving power (andgt;200,000). However, the detector is currently the missing link in\nthis exciting development. With the new detector technology, a whole new class of imaging mass spectrometers can\nbe developed and brought to market.\nOur superconducting detector technology (a superconducting delay line or SCDL, pronounced skiddle) delivers 100%\ndetection while capturing the high mass resolving power on unfragmented large-mass molecules like proteins. It is fast\n(andgt;108 molecules\/second) and expandable to large areas (andgt;4 cm2). A proof-of-concept project was completed in the past\nyear. We are commercializing this technology for biomolecule time-of-flight detection as part of our grand vision to\nspectroscopically map all molecules in a cell. We have built a team of academic and commercial experts in biological\nmass spectrometry (MS) and superconducting detectors and electronics. We will develop a highly parallel tessellated\ndetector with integrated superconducting electronics on the detector wafer. The first step in commercialization, this\nPhase I program, is thorough simulation of the detector and its electronics in collaboration with SeeQC, Inc. (formerly\nHypres, Inc.). When complete, we will have a high level of confidence in its expected performance. In our Phase II, we\nwill fabricate a working detector with SeeQC and evaluate its performance in a test MS system on real biomolecular\nspecimens. Commercializing the SCDL detector for high performance time-of-flight mass spectrometry is the first stage\nof our plans for this detector technology. In our second stage of development, we will design and build the technology\nfor recording time-of-flight encoded images. In other words, the detector will be used to record megapixel stigmatic\nimages that will allow us to push the spatial resolution of the imaging mass spectrometer to better than 100 nm. The\nproposed new detector technology will enable major advancements in life sciences and related industries.Project Narrative\nThis research will develop a detector for biomolecules needed to map the proteins, enzymes, etc. in the cells in our bodies.\nThis information is used to develop more effective drug treatments, diagnose disease at the earliest stages, and generally\ndevelop a better understanding of how life functions. All branches of health and life science research and knowledge may\nbe beneficially affected by the new information this detection capability brings."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT:The previously funded STTR (Fast Track Phase I\/II, preclinical studies) project (R41\/R42 CA173980-01A)\nhelped us in developing desired NIR PS (Photobac) with a great potential for both cancer imaging and therapy.\nAn efficient method for the synthesis of Photobac was also established in a GMP facility. Following the US\nFDA guidelines, the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and toxicity of Photobac in various doses\nwere also investigated in mice, rats and dogs. Histopathology results did not show any organ toxicity. Photobac\neven at a 20-fold higher than the therapeutic dose (single dose needed for the treatment) was not lethal. No\nmetabolite formation and organ toxicity even at higher than the desired therapeutic dose was observed. The\nbiodistribution of C-14 Photobac at variable time points was also determined in mice and rats [7, 8]. Results\nwith C-14 Photobac in rats and fluorescence results in mice suggest that Photobac crosses the blood brain\nbarrier (BBB).A positive pre-IND response from the US FDA on our request for the use of Photobac to treat Gliomas was\npleasing andamp; exciting (Application # PIND 136905). As suggested by the FDA review committee, the revision of\nhuman patient Phase I protocol has been accomplished. NIR PS Photobac has also received an \u201cOrphan\nDrug\u201d status from the US FDA for imaging and therapy of Glioblastoma (fluorescence-guided surgery +\nPDTof recurrence tumors) (# DRU-2017-6153), which further encouraged us to move this technology to\nPhase I human clinical trials. To achieve our goal, the proposed study (SBIR: Preclinical and Clinical)) has\nbeen divided into following aims:\nAim 1 (a): To investigate the PDT efficacy of Photobac in rat glioma model and using Simphotek\u2019s proprietary\ncomputational device FPDosi\u2122 (Beeson et al. J. Biomed. Opt. 24(3), 035006, 2019) compare light dose to\nexperiments. Details are presented in the letter of support from Simphotek. Aim 1 (b): To compile the\nPhotobac CMC (chemistry, manufacturing and control), drug-formulation, stability of drug substance and drug\nproduct, analytical details, PK\/PD, toxicity, in vitro andamp; in vivo data and Phase I clinical protocol for an IND\nsubmission to the US FDA for fluorescence image guided surgery + PDT of glioblastoma. The cost of the IND\nsubmission will be paid by Photolitec, LLC.\nAim 2: To compile the details of PS (Photobac)-customized NIR laser instrument (787 nm, developed with the\nhelp of Biolitec) following the US FDA guidelines, and submit it for approval (combined IND-Aim 1].\nAim 3: To perform Phase I trial with Photobac-PDT, fluorescence-guided treatment (surgery + PDT) of\nglioblastoma at a single light dose and variable drug doses for selecting the best treatment parameters.\nAim 4: To provide tissue samples from glioblastoma, corresponding non-tumor tissue, untreated tumors,\nPhotobac-PDT treated tumors and recurrent tumors after previous surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and\nchemotherapy treatment, for Photobac specificity using 3D cell-culture system, and STAT3 crosslinks analysis.\nAim 5: Establish a correlation between the cell-uptake on patients\u2019 tumors (at various stages) implanted in\nmice, photo-induced STAT3 dimerization and a long-term PDT response [7]. Translate these findings to\nenhance the optimal treatment parameter(s) of glioblastoma patients.NarrativeThis project in focused on developing a Near infrared photosensitizer (Photobac) for\ncancer-imaging (fluorescence guided surgery) and photodynamic therapy of Glioblastoma, and\nincludes Phase I clinical trials also. The FDA response on a pre-IND meeting was very\nencouraging, and as suggested the IND submission on Photobac-PDT for treating glioblastoma\nis being prepared accordingly. Recently, Photobac also received an \u201cOrphan Drug Status\u201d from\nthe US FDA, which has been very encouraging to Photolitec. The results obtained for PK\/PD\nand Toxicity studies with Photobac in mice, rats and dogs at variable doses did not show any\norgan toxicity. Photolitec is a spin-off of Roswell Park Cancer Institute, and the Phase I clinical\nstudies will be performed in RPCI under the supervision of Dr. Fenstermaker, a neurosurgeon,\nProf Wilson andamp; Potter, renowned physicists, who have extensive experience of basic and clinical\nPDT. Prof. Pandey, well known for his contributions in PDT (one of the photosensitizers\ndeveloped by him is currently in Phase II Clinical trials of head andamp; neck cancer) will help in\ncoordinating scientists, clinicians and other research and administrative personnel between the\nRPCI , Photolitec and the US FDA."

        "Abstract": "Summary. Our long-term goal is to develop a powerful tool based on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) for non-\ninvasive human skin imaging in order to improve clinical diagnosis, guide effective treatment and advance\nclinical and cosmetic\/pharmaceutical research by providing access to dynamic cellular and molecular\nprocesses during therapy. MPM is a nonlinear optical imaging technique that provides unique structural and\nmolecular contrast based on endogenous signals such as second harmonic generation from collagen and two-\nphoton excited fluorescence from NADH\/FAD+, keratin, melanin and elastin fibers. This contrast allows MPM\nto provide multi-color, rich molecular information content images that can enhance diagnostic accuracy. MPM\novercomes fundamental limitations of existing optical imaging technologies for sub-surface skin imaging and\nextends the area of applicability beyond skin lesions that can be diagnosed through morphological assessment\nalone. Validation of the clinical potential of this technology has been facilitated over the past 10 years by a\ndevice developed by Jenlab in Germany, currently the only clinical MPM system on the market. This device\nhas technical limitations in terms of field-of-view (FOV), imaging speed, complexity and cost, which are major\nbarriers to clinical adoption. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to develop and test the technical feasibility for\nin vivo human skin imaging of a MPM system that is highly optimized for rapid, label-free, macroscopic imaging\nof human skin with microscopic resolution. The Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) imaging\nplatform will incorporate the innovative optical engine of a benchtop prototype developed at BLI. InfraDerm will\ninnovate on this design to transform it into a compact, portable device, suitable for human skin imaging in\nclinical setting. Key innovations include: 1) a compact engineering design based on integrating a compact fs\nfiber laser into the imaging head along with a customized folded optical design to reduce complexity and cost\nand enhance portability; 2) hardware and software strategies that include a customized patient interface and a\ncombination of optical and mechanical scanning mechanisms with deep learning image restoration to allow\nmillimeter-to-centimeter scale imaging within minutes while maintaining sub-micron resolution. This approach\nwill expand the in vivo imaging area from mm to cm scale, which will be scanned within minutes with sub-\ncellular resolution. In Aim 1 we will develop the FLAME prototype that incorporates these features. In Aim 2 we\nwill test its technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging by evaluating potential effects of motion artifacts.\nIn Aim 3, we will demonstrate the FLAME system potential for non-invasive assessment of melanin content, an\nability with potential impact in differential diagnosis and early assessment of treatment efficacy of pigmentary\nskin disorders, such as melasma. Phase II will refine the technological approach and will test the device\nfeasibility in a first clinical application, differential diagnosis of patients with melasma, a long time dermatology\nchallenge and a particular interest for pharma companies developing therapies for this skin condition.NarrativeInfraDerm LLC proposes to develop and test the technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging of\na laser scanning microscope based on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) that addresses fundamental and\ntechnical limitations of existing optical imaging technologies for sub-surface skin imaging, extending the area of\napplicability beyond skin lesions that can be diagnosed through morphological assessment alone. The\nproposed Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) prototype will be highly optimized for rapid, label-\nfree, macroscopic imaging of human skin with microscopic resolution. An MPM clinical platform, uniquely\nequipped with this combination of features would embody an innovative and commercially viable product that\nwill broadly impact clinical diagnosis and research in dermatology as well as in cosmetic and pharmaceutical\nresearch."

        "Abstract": "AI Platform for Microscopy Image Restoration and Virtual Staining\nProject Summary:Fluorescence microscopy has enabled many major discoveries in biomedical sciences. Despite the\nrapid advancements in optics, lasers, probes, cameras and novel techniques, major factors such as spatial\nand temporal resolution, light exposure, signal-to-noise, depth of penetration and probe spectra continue\nto limit the types of experiments that are possible. Deep learning (DL) algorithms are well suited for\nimage-based problems like SNR\/super-resolution restoration and virtual staining, which have great\nenabling potentials for microscopy experiments. Previously impossible experiments could be realized such\nas achieving high signal-to-noise and\/or spatial-temporal resolution without photobleaching\/phototoxicity;\nsimultaneously observing many image channels without interfering with native processes, etc. This could\npave the way for a quantum leap forward in microscopy-based discoveries that elucidate biological\nfunctions and the mechanisms of disorders, and enable new diagnostics and therapies for human diseases.However, these new methods have not been widely translated to new microscopy experiments. The\ndelay is due to several practical hurdles and challenges such as required expertise, computing and trust. In\norder to accelerate the adoption of DL in microscopy, novel AI platform tailored for biologists are needed\nfor training, applying and validating DL models and outputs.The present project aims to develop an AI platform for microscopy image restoration and virtual\nstaining called AI for Restoring and Staining (AIRS) platform. With our collaborator, Dr. Hari Shroff\n(National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering) we have successfully created DL models for\nSNR restoration, super-resolution restoration and virtual staining for a variety of imaging conditions and\norganelles in our preliminary studies. The AIRS platform intends to (1)provide a comprehensive suite of\nvalidated DL models for microscopy restoration and virtual staining applications including SNR\nrestoration, super-resolution restoration, spatial deconvolution, spectral unmixing, prediction of 3d from\n2d images, organelle virtual staining and analysis; (2)provide plug and play for common microscopy\nexperiments; (3)provide semi-automatic update training to tailor DL models to match advanced\nmicroscopy experiments; (4)provide user friendly support for new DL model training for pioneering\nmicroscopy experiments; (5)provide confidence scores to assess the output results by a DL model, (6)\nprovide DL models that avoid image artifact (hallucination) and allow continuous learning and evolution;\n(7) and be able to access the required computing infrastructure and database connection.Project Narrative\nDeep learning (DL) algorithms have great enabling potentials for microscopy experiments.

        "Abstract": "ASRC Federal Astronautics (AFA) is pleased to propose this plan to perform a feasibility study of using Selective Laser Melting (SLM) Additive Manufacturing (AM) to produce grain boundary engineered (GBE) 316L austenitic stainless steel. Coincident site lattice (CSL) and low-angle grain boundaries, which result from GBE, improve metal alloys\u2019 properties such as fatigue life and stress\/corrosion cracking. Fatigue life is an area of concern for AM technologies, as they tend to produce materials that have lower fatigue properties than their traditionally manufactured counterparts. In addition, GBE grains are, by necessity, equiax grains, whereas AM\u2019s rapid cooling encourages elongated columnar grains in the \u201cas-built\u201d condition because of limited nucleation cites for grain boundary formation. AFA proposes implementing two different approaches for obtaining equiax grains in the \u201cas-built\u201d 316L austenitic stainless steel with a focus on identifying the feasibility of using these for GBE. Method one involves using an ultrasonic transducer attached to the build plate to manipulate the microstructure during solidification of the meltpool. Method two uses titanium carbide (TiC) nanoparticles mixed into 316L austenitic stainless steel using a ball mill. Both methods increase the amount of nucleation cites, promoting equiax grain formation. These methods will be investigated independently and together to judge both their relative effectiveness at producing equiax and GBE grains. This approach has the potential to create three commercializable technologies. Ultrasonics can readily be employed across various machines and alloys while also being nearly non-invasive in that it does not requires customized SLM computer software or optics systems to further control laser parameters. Adding TiC nanoparticles to 316L leads to developing processes for nano-reinforcing other alloys as well. Finally, using one or both of these methods together perform GBE in 316L is a stepping stone to developing GBE processes in even more SLM AM alloys such as GRCop-84, Inconel alloys, aluminum alloys, etc."

Addressing the slow growth rate of the quantum cascade laser active region, overgrowth for buried-heterostructure fabrication, and devices packaging, we provide all-wafer-level manufacturing protocols that can considerably reduce the current manufacturing cost quantum cascade laser devices. Based on our estimation, successful demonstration of our approach should provide at least 10.15 times cost reduction, resulting in less than $100 for a single quantum cascade laser emitting at 4.6 \u00b5m with output power level over 1 W under continuous wave mode at room temperature, offering"

        "Abstract": "Traditional flight termination systems (FTS) rely on a man-in-the-loop to monitor vehicle flight path and related vehicle trajectory performance parameters based on multiple radar tracking sources along with sensory data sent from onboard the vehicle via telemetry. An autonomous flight safety system (AFSS) brings the decision process onboard the vehicle via digital high-speed processing of positional data coming from onboard sensors, such as global positioning system (GPS), Optical (star or sun trackers), laser, and\/or inertial measurement system (IMU) sensors. The sensor type is flexible in the architecture, but may require a software adjustment for the sensors position, velocity, and time (PVT) transmission formats. The Range Safety (RS) preprogrammed flight path and keep-out areas, along with flight deviation allowances, and related safety rules are uploaded to the AFSS prior to launch and stored in protective computer memory. The AFSS continuously determines the instantaneous impact point (IIP) of the vehicle based on real-time navigation data obtained from the onboard sensors. Current AFSS have been primarily designed for pad-launched systems; however, submarine-launched missiles present some unique issues that must be considered when leveraging this existing technology."

The objective of this proposed effort is to significantly reduce the size and weight, and improve the efficiency of pulsed power systems for flashlamp pumped Nd:Glass HEL applications, suitable for operation as a pod-contained payload supporting operation in the next generation of tactical aircraft laser weapons.The final system requirements indicate that over an order of magnitude improvement in size, weight and power (SWaP) from the current laboratory laser system will be necessary. Achieving these goals will require a paradigm shift in the pulse power technology. This paradigm shift must come from the basic components used in the pulse power system which include capacitors, high voltage switches, and inductors, as well as laser efficiency improvement due to pump chamber design."

        "Abstract": "The Navy seeks to develop a low SWaP, multi-band, 780-nm, laser system with five separate, stabilized laser frequencies locked near the Rb85 D2 line in order to drive the necessary atomic transitions for quantum sensing based on atom interferometry. The currently employed method of accessing all necessary frequencies uses multiple independent lasers - each with separate saturated absorption locks. The current method is unrealistic for mobile sensor development because it demands large size and weight and adds the complication of requiring multiple, independent locking mechanisms to stabilize each laser frequency and intensity. Q-Peak proposes a method to demonstrate an innovative, low SWaP, narrow bandwidth, linearly polarized, fiber-integrated multi-band, 780-nm, laser system with frequency stability to within 10 kHz of the respective atomic transitions and intensity fluctuations below 0.1% of the output intensity, polarization stability to within 0.01 degrees, and a laser bandwidth less than 50 kHz for atom interferometry applications. Our innovative approach significantly reduces the number of optical components and results in a narrow bandwidth, low phase noise, low SWaP 780-nm multi-band laser system."

        "Abstract": "The technical objectives of the proposal are: 1) perform a comprehensive simulation of ~ 4.0 micron-emitting QCLs with suppressed carrier leakage and reduced built-in voltage for achieving pulsed wall-plug efficiency &gt; 15 %; 2) perform a thermal analysis of ~ 4.0 micron-emitting QCL structures and achieve a design for single-spatial-mode operation at 5 W CW output power and 15 % CW wall-plug efficiency; 3) establish the material-related parameters for ~ 4 micron-emitting QCL structures. QCLs will be designed for virtually suppressing the overall carrier leakage out of their active regions and achieving fast carrier extraction from their active regions. In addition, an approach for significantly reducing the overall voltage will be incorporated into the device design. Novel thermal management approaches will be designed in order to minimize the overall thermal conductance of the packaged device. Prototype plans will be created for devices to developed during Phase II, by conducting thermal simulations on fully packaged QCLs. As part of the Option portion of the proposed effort, based on the design reached during the Base portion, ~ 4 micron-emitting QCL structures will be grown and evaluated under pulsed-operation conditions. The grown material will also be used for extracting material-related parameters, to provide a benchmark for QCL material optimization during Phase II. Successful completion of the proposed program will not only enable the realization, in Phase II, of multiwatt-range, highly efficient and long-term reliable ~ 4.0 micron-emitting QCLs, but also provide a springboard for future QCL development for achieving higher power and efficiency at wavelengths below 4 microns."

        "Abstract": "BANC3 proposes the use of Augmented Reality (AR) technology to enhance the capabilities of aircraft maintainers, \u00a0by giving more natural, intuitive, hands-free instruction. Benefits include reducing manning and empowering the ability to rapidly employ advanced equipment such as cold-spray metallization and clean-laser systems, and using recording capability, providing an accurate, objective assessment of material readiness such as corrosion state. We will demonstrate unique Mixed Reality (MR) capabilities such as the ability to display virtual objects, using a currently available \u201cbest-of-breed\u201d AR product and applications running on a common, open-source operating system capable of completely stand-alone operation, and we will provide a path to a military-hardened product that meets all environmental, ElectroMagnetic Interference\/ Compatibility (EMI\/ C) and Information Assurance Requirements for operation in a maritime environment.\u00a0 We will assess the applicability of currently available AR smartglasses and technology to aircraft maintenance practices as well as to use of advanced equipment such as cold-spray metallization and clean-laser trimming systems. We will suggest specific functions based upon customer input \/ need and the availability of suitable software applications. \u00a0Then we will demonstrate these and quantitatively demonstrate the benefits in reduced manpower and\/ or enhanced effectiveness. The training demonstration may use the full suite of current ThirdEye user interface functions including head gestures, pushbuttons (the pushbuttons on the ThirdEye product, with the cursor moved by head gesture), and\/ or voice recognition and gesture controls. These may be used to enhance the user experience while using available, open-standard instruction.\u00a0 We will prepare for trainee use, three-dimensional virtual training material using markerless SLAM capability (available in the BANC3 ThirdEye product, this function will be available in the selected technology following the survey portion of this program). We will show how AR can provide an Objective record for Aircraft Inspection actions and results. This can include cleaning, coatings removal, non-destructive inspection, with full, high resolution video recording of all procedures. The video recordings will provide an accurate record of Material Readiness Condition. We will also show Other NDI features, e.g. providing an external camera feed into the MR Smartglasses, to easily enable inspections in tight places (into which a user cannot fit). As part of this phase, we can consider providing multi-level hearing protection, including active noise cancellation, for an inspector using the selected AR \u00a0smartglasses."

        "Abstract": "Q-Peak proposes a high power Thulium (Tm) doped fiber amplifier design operating at 2 \u00b5m wavelength utilizing a novel lateral fiber fusion side-pumping method and a nanoparticle doping technique to generate significant signal power and performance.\u00a0 The proposed fusion side-pumping method will distribute the pump power along the length of the active fiber, allowing the high power amplifier to yield a relatively uniform gain distribution and a distributed thermal load. The fusion side-pumping method, consisting of fusing a coreless passive fiber to a Tm-doped double clad fiber, will provide significant cross-coupling between the input pump power and the cladding of the active fiber. This high power amplifier model will avoid thermal loading issues seen experimentally in end-pumping high power Thulium fiber lasers.\u00a0 Q-Peak\u2019s high power amplifier design will utilize a fusion region between the two fibers long enough to be able to efficiently pump bi-directionally without damaging any pump diode lasers. Additionally, the proposed nanoparticle doping method, developed by NRL, will intentionally cluster Tm ions into intimate contact in order exploit the \u201ctwo-for-one\u201d cross-relaxation phenomena observed in Thulium ions in close proximity.\u00a0 The location of the Tm ions will be effectively controlled, causing the cross-relaxation process to require less ions.\u00a0 Therefore, there is less absorption and less thermal load on the active fiber.\u00a0 Utilizing these two methods will allow for a novel amplifier prototype capable of signal power in excess of 1 kW without having significant thermal load issues in the active fiber."

In order to quickly (within 5 months) deliver an integrated DLS prototype solution, ours will be hosted on an existing machine learning enabled, multi-enterprise\/multi-tier supply chain collaboration platform called SDX.\u00a0 Our DLS incorporates more than sophisticated technology or the ability to scrape web sites and product catalogues to map a hypothetical supply chain of possible suppliers and subcontractors for medical equipment, supplies and care.\u00a0 It is designed and developed to address challenges that are far more complex and nuanced.\u00a0 This is where the collective expertise of our team, informed by years of actual experience in managing end-to-end supply chains, monitoring medical supply chain risks, and handling electronic medical records across a vast network of hospitals, comes into play. Our DLS solution for Medical Care will demonstrate in Phase 1 not Phase 3, the ability to: Quickly and easily map, and validate medical equipment, supplies and constituent parts, ingredients, and suppliers (tier 1- tier n) and keep them up-to-date and accurate over time. Transform \u201cunstructured\u201d data from multiple independent sources (data that fails to conform to a heterogenous naming convention and data taxonomy) into a usable corpus of reliable \u201cstructured data\u201d that can then support real-time, DON analytics and decision making.\u00a0 This is a foundational capability that will ensure that this project does not fall victim to frequently encountered \u201cgarbage in-garbage-out\u201d scenarios that often plague projects of this nature.\u00a0 Rank and approve certain suppliers based on their location, ownership, country of origin, credit rating, and n-tier dependencies. keep information (about suppliers, equipment, supplies, inventory levels, etc.) up-to date and accurate over time and without significant manual intervention. This ability to authenticate material and product flow \u00a0and where possible, automate them, is essential because BOM data for medical equipment and supplies, like other information already managed in our core platform, ages quickly due to such things as: new part introductions, engineering\/design changes, source selection changes, expiration dates, and end of life (EOL) considerations.\u00a0 Without this capability, timely use and\/or destruction of supplies with limited shelf life could make matters worse, not better.\u00a0 Because these capabilities come \u201cout of the box\u201d in the core platform, it means that vital resources in Phases 1 and any that follow, will be laser focused on ways to elegantly combine the valuable capabilities of project partners and meet DON reporting requirements."

Carbon and glass fiber reinforced polymers are very abrasive and wear traditional tooling quickly. Furthermore, metallic honeycomb reinforcement has different characteristics requiring different speeds and feeds accelerating tool wear further. Using a laser to machine composite hybrid stacks will eliminate a need for expensive tooling. The Phase I research demonstrated feasibility for laser machining hybrid composite stacks. The Phase I research showed the heat affected zone could be kept below 0.010\u201d without interlayer delamination, blow out plies, or other mechanical damage. The Phase II will develop a prototype machine capable of machining countersinks in hybrid composite stacks up to 1\u201d thick. Phase II base will: 1. Utilize multiphysics simulations to predict the machining process. 2. Develop feedback to control the machining process. 3. Implement a localized safety system so the process can be portable without being hazardous to workers. 4. Manufacture, characterize, and non-destructively inspect the machined specimens. Phase II option will: 1. Develop a refined correlation between physical machining process and simulations. 2. Refine the user interface. 3. Refine and finalized the feedback systems developed in phase II base. 4. Demonstrate machine effectiveness with test coupons."

        "Abstract": "The Navy has made a substantial investment in fiber-based high-energy lasers (HELs) as evidenced by the HELIOS program. Efficient, low size, weight and power (SWaP) are essential for deployment of the HELs on mobile platforms. The SWaP of fiber-based HELs is largely dictated by the efficiency and SWaP of laser diode fiber coupled modules (FCMs). Under Phase 1, SRL experimentally demonstrated a 51-53% efficient, kilowatt (kW), low-SWaP (0.7cc\/W, 0.7g\/W) FCM. In Year 1 of the Phase 2 effort, SRL will increase the FCM efficiency to 57% and by the end of the Base Phase 2 program, will deliver a 60%, kW FCM to MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT LL). The SWaP of the FCM delivered to MIT LL will be 0.5cc\/W and 0.5g\/W. Efficient, low-SWaP kW FCMs are essential for ship-based defense that require =300kW HELs to defend ships against increasingly sophisticated missiles. It is noteworthy that there are no efficient, low-SWaP commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) kW FCMs available. Under the Phase 2 Option, SRL will deliver six, 60% efficient low-SWaP FCMs to MIT LL. These FCMs will be the basis for demonstrating a &gt;45%, 5kW high-power fiber laser."

The proposed laser design concept allows for scaling of continuous-wave power output from mid-wave infrared quantum cascade lasers beyond the current state-of-the-art. In Phase II, the proposing team will demonstrate a single QCL device producing &gt; 5 W room temperature continuous wave optical power with diffraction limited beam by improving thermal impedance of the device by a factor of two."

        "Abstract": "Systems &amp; Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC) proposes an optical proximity fuze, based on techniques developed for its product line of small, autonomous LADARs. The proposed Optical Proximity Fuze provides key advantages: 1) the fuze receive detectors are inexpensive pin diodes vs. APDs; 2) the fuze operates at low power levels and in all light conditions; 3) the fuze is immune to battlefield RF interference and jamming; 4) the fuze will be implemented in a single, ultra-hardened optical MCM to meet extreme shock, acceleration, and vibration specifications; and 5) the fuze optical MCM can be placed into high volume, low cost production. The optical proximity fuze has an ultra wide angle pickup array with phase encoded Barker 13 pulse compression to achieve a signal-to-noise enhancement of 13\/1. A link analysis of representative air conditions resulted in a 43\/1 signal-to-noise with a single laser pulse and a 2.23x improvement with our 5 laser pulse algorithm. SPEC\u2019s extensive experience in packaging of artillery fired electronics will be applied to form a module that will survive the 50,000G shock and all other specified environments. The proposed combination of performance, extreme hardness and cost will yield an ideal proximity fuze for the modern battlefield."

The low-power DROIC will be optimized for polarity-independent operation when coupled to the variety of detector arrays sensitive over the reflected infrared (i.e., SWIR) or thermal infrared (i.e., MWIR or LWIR) spectral regions. In Phase I, after working with the government stakeholders to refine the DROIC operational requirements, the readout circuit architecture will be defined and transistor-level design, modeling, and simulation of the critical pixel and readout circuits will be performed. In the Phase I option, the pixel circuits and layout will be completed, and their performance will be simulated against the process corners. The Phase I and Phase I option will sufficiently demonstrate feasibility and reduce program risk for a Phase II program award that will allow the DROIC to be completed through tape-out."

        "Abstract": "The innovation described in the Phase I proposal \u201cAdditive Manufacturing and Characterization of Radome Materials\u201d is to achieve the first fiber-reinforced ceramic composite manufactured with selective laser sintering (SLS) Additive manufacturing (AM). The innovation is twofold, (i) development of a novel rapid-cured fiber-reinforced preceramic composite material that can be (ii) additively manufactured via SLS and cured in-situ. The project will use a new SOTA SLS 3D printer developed by Dr. Beaman\u2019s lab at the University of Texas at Austin. The printer, referred to as \u201cLaser Additive Manufacturing Pilot System\u201d or LAMPS, utilizes 40 heaters, 3 quartz lamps, two MWIR cameras, and one visual camera for in situ monitoring. LAMPS is a uniquely capable system for 3D printing thermosets, combining its cutting-edge optical system, in-situ monitoring, and precisely-controlled heating capabilities. While KAI will be employing SLS there will be no actual sintering or melting of the preceramic powder system. Instead the laser will be used to activate a catalyst within the powder system causing a partial crosslinking to occur. The preceramic system will be a blend of solventless polysiloxane with ceramic microfibers and a laser-activated catalyst. The AM process will result in a stable preceramic greenbody part with an excellent resolution of 120-150 \u00b5m. Pyrolysis of the printed greenbody will be necessary to achieve the final functionally graded SiOC ceramic radome. For Phase I A total of three prototype ceramic composites will printed and undergo preliminary characterization. The materials will be examined for chemical composition, heat capacity, and thermal expansion metrics. Additionally, comprehensive methods for further high temperature (500 to 1500\u00b0C) will be identified and\/or developed for more extensive materials characterization in Phase II. The successful conclusion of Phase I will be a proof of concept for KAI\u2019s innovative AM technique for ceramic components. Phase II will see further exploration of this concept and KAI will expand its ceramic AM portfolio to include SiC, SiCN, and SiON. Additionally, in Phase II, fillers which may positively impact the pyrolysis chemistry during ceramic conversion will be fully considered. KAI will use Phase II to validate the mechanical, thermal, and dielectric character of ceramics developed in Phase I as well as new ceramics developed in Phase II. Ultimately KAI has a detailed commercialization plan in place for Phase III rollout. Emphasis on Phase III will be the sale or lease of KAI technology to US Missile Defense contractors while maintaining the capability of manufacturing small batch orders of functionally graded hypersonic radomes for the US Army. Upon the transfer of technology to appropriate defense contractors, KAI may pivot its technology to offer commercially available AM of ceramic and thermoset parts for the aerospace, oil and gas, and automotive industries."

For handheld operation, user jitter significantly limits the range that can be achieved, and moving targets require the user to precisely pan and tilt the designator to maintain energy on the target. While relatively simple image stabilization techniques will neutralize hand jitter, reliable target detection and laser spot imaging are needed to maintain an aimpoint on a moving target. To address this critical need, Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) proposes to develop the Handheld Laser Designator (HandLD). \u00a0The key innovations of the proposed effort are the development of laser steering techniques together with a mature and efficient control algorithm and processing hardware."

        "Abstract": "The Army has identified potential shortcomings in the handheld designator\/marker technology of future compact designator systems when targeting moving targets.\u00a0 A smaller, lighter laser designator system combined with automatic tracking and pointing will enhance the soldier\u2019s mobility and reduce fatigue.\u00a0 A miniature, lightweight laser beam stabilizer component is required to maintain the required volume and weight of the handheld laser designator\/marker.\u00a0 Arete proposes a Monolithic LOS Stabilized (MLOSS) laser designator\/marker system was designed based on innovative laser beam steering technology.\u00a0 The design developed will demonstrate meeting the performance metrics as defined by the system requirements for a moving target. The approach uses a lens shift technique that is able to meet the large angular dynamic range while simultaneously meeting the necessary precision.\u00a0 Both a low risk and moderate risk lens actuator technology are used to meet the design requirements with a diffraction limited optical design.\u00a0 The external disturbances (hand tremor) are detected using a MEMS IMU consisting of angular rate gyroscopes and accelerometers combined with video tracking.\u00a0 The measured disturbances are used in the control loop embedded on an ARM processor that sends control signals to the lens actuators to maintain beam stabilization. The entire beam expander that contains the stabilization mechanism and control electronics are contained in a 50 mm long package as defined by the notional design for a 4x beam expander."

        "Abstract": "With its wide band gap allowing high voltages, high currents, and high temperatures, compensated gallium nitride (GaN) is a good candidate for constructing optically triggered switches that can operate at high voltage, current, and temperature. To achieve high responsivity GaN-based switches are often triggered with above bandgap photons, which are difficult to obtain at sufficient fluxes and in small packages with current technologies. This proposed work will integrate a compensated In-containing channel layer to the PCSS device in order to slightly shift the bandedge and take advantage of widely available and powerful blue laser diode sources. The devices are targeted to operate at &gt;150 C and will be designed to hold off 1200 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2000 V, while supplying 10 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 120 A. A responsivity of at least 0.5 A \/ W at 1200 V is anticipated."

        "Abstract": "The U.S. military has a long history in developing directed energy\u00a0weapons, which offer a variety of advantages over conventional kinetic weapons including precision, low cost per shot, and adjustable dose for both non-lethal and lethal targets. In 2014, the Navy deployed the 30kW\u00a0Laser Weapon System (LaWS), and with the need to target larger and faster objects at greater distances, the Navy is planning deployment of the High Energy Laser and Integrated Optical-dazzler with Surveillance system (HELIOS) in 2021. The Navy has recently shown interest in extending shipboard high energy laser (HEL) weapon capability to the undersea world of the submarine, to enable surprise attack and deterrent capability across the oceans. Early Navy designs for this aperture are to make it common for a laser rangefinders and sensors as well, specifying the need for broadband transmission from the visible through the mid-wave infrared (MWIR). Suitable materials for this requirement include sapphire, spinel, and ALON. While the technology of laser weapons has advanced in recent years, the undersea application presents the unique and potentially show-stopping problem that cannot be addressed with conventional coatings- how can the physical interface or exit aperture between the ocean and laser weapon be maintained to the durability, antireflection level, and cleanliness specifications that are required laser optics? \u00a0\u00a0 An innovative and rugged method for providing extreme\u00a0bandwidth,\u00a0self-cleaning properties, and laser damage resistance involves the fabrication of a nanometer scale surface relief texture into the Beam Director Head Windows.\u00a0\u00a0A texture consisting of randomly distributed features, the RAR Nano-Texture, imparts a graded index function that has been shown to be far superior to thin film coatings with respect to transmission, bandwidth, and off-axis performance; as well as exhibiting ultra-hydrophobic and self-cleaning properties.\u00a0 As a comprehensive Phase I proof of concept for extending the advances made in the nano-texturing of fused silica, TelAztec will design, model, and fabricate RAR nano-textured apertures in relevant visible thru MWIR transparent materials to meet the Navy\u2019s desire for a submarine based HEL exit aperture. Particular modeling effort will focus on producing 99.9% transmission at the HEL wavelength near 1\u00b5m. Tradeoffs in aperture materials, design, complexity, and manufacturability will be discussed. To address the need for self-cleaning properties, the super-hydrophobic nature of RAR nano-textured surfaces will be demonstrated, attaining a contact angle of greater than 150\u00b0.\u00a0\u00a0With a look forward to Phase II work, the Phase I option will include exposing high quality, low absorption RAR nano-textured windows to prolonged sea water exposure, followed by CW laser damage testing of the samples at the laser weapon line of 1070nm."

        "Abstract": "Hepburn and Sons LLC is pleased to submit this proposal to develop SUBSAFE Electrical Hull Penetrator (EHP) Connectors for Directed Energy (DE) Weapon Systems. Hepburn has teamed with the highly qualified manufacturer AMETEK SCP Inc. to design, develop, and test the HP-EHP during the execution of this SBIR. The Navy seeks technologies for transmitting the high electrical power from inboard US submarines to support the operation of DE systems and other undersea platforms and weapons systems or to support Special Operations Forces (SOF). The current vision and one of the stated committed goals of US Navy (USN) leadership is to move towards the development of DE weapon systems that will offer an integral new set of technologies and unique new capabilities (both defensive and offensive) into the USN submarine forces. This effort to develop a High-Power Electrical Hull Penetrator (HP-EHP) will support a potential US submarine DE integration such as the surface navy\u2019s High Energy Laser and Integrated Optical Dazzler with Surveillance (HELIOS) effort. The strategy to accomplish this goal of deploying a DE weapon onto submarines and supporting other systems from submarines requires USN submarines to serve as a source of high electrical power levels capable of supplying the electrical energy needs of power-hungry undersea systems. In addition to supporting the needs of a future DE system or other systems, the USN must develop the capability to support various sizes and configurations of Unmanned Undersea \u00a0Vehicles (UUVs) such as the US Navy\u2019s Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (XLUUV)\u00a0and the Large Displacement Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (LDUUVs) as outlined in the US Navy Strategic Unmanned Systems Roadmap.\u00a0In addition to unmanned systems, the USN is also interested in the ability to more easily support off-board manned vehicles used by SOF, such as Sea Air Land (SEAL) Delivery Vehicles (SDVs), which are wet subs designed to transport frogmen from a combat swimmer unit or naval Special Forces underwater, over long distances. In order to support the range of potential systems identified above, the Navy must first develop a SUBSAFE EHP connector embedded in the submarine\u2019s pressure hull, which would be capable of transferring the high currents or high voltages in the order of 100\u2019s of kilowatts (kW)."

As a worldwide leading company in single-frequency fiber lasers, NP Photonics proposes to develop butterfly-type single-frequency fiber lasers by taking advantage of our mature short-length fiber laser technology based on our unique highly doped gain fiber and micro-optics packaging capability. In the Phase I program, we will demonstrate the feasibility of developing a\u00a0diode-pumped single-frequency fiber laser oscillator at 1.55 um with an industrial butterfly package. Butterfly-type, single-frequency fiber lasers at 1.55 um meeting or exceeding the requirements of the Navy\u2019s applications will be developed\u00a0 in Phase II."

Electronic technology is increasingly challenged with threat frequencies exceeding 20 GHz as coaxial cables typically used for these applications have increased loss with increasing frequency and are subject to electromagnetic interference Photonic technology is suitable for frequencies above 100 GHz and provides comprehensive electromagnetic maneuver warfare solutions. One of the key components necessary to providing low noise figures is the development of compact low phase noise lasers. In this SBIR, we will focus on shot-noise-limited, narrow linewidth, diode-pumped, solid-state lasers as low noise photonic sources."

        "Abstract": "The design and fabrication of new aircraft tires is a complex process that is dictated by numerous performance requirements. Typically, tire performance is demonstrated based on the operational loads and speeds required for successful takeoff and landing, however actual tire wear remains uncontrolled. The USAF developed a test program that uses runway surface replicas for tire wear prediction. Currently, these replicas are fabricated by specialized concrete manufacturers, which is expensive, time consuming, and precludes precise imitation of runway surfaces. One way to create exact runway replicas is to scan the actual runway surface to generate 3D data files, and fabricate tiles using additive manufacturing (AM). In Phase I, UTC successfully demonstrated the ability to fabricate replicas of runway surfaces with a Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) AM technique. In Phase II, UTC will scale the process up to full-size tiles and fully characterize the performance of fabricated parts intended for use by the AF LGTF to support laboratory tire wear testing. AM of test tiles presents an exceptional opportunity for accelerated production of high-fidelity runway surface replicas. Moreover, AM offers production stability as the government could own the equipment or outsource tile fabrication and thus control the production workflow."

        "Abstract": "The prolific use of lasers in ground and air combat increases the likelihood of catastrophic eye damage that can result in temporary and permanent blindness. The Eclipse Energy Systems (Eclipse) Laser Eye Protection (LEP) filter blocks NIR laser threats while providing high transmittance in the visible. These filters can be used as an effective stand-alone laser eye protection for various SOCOM forces, including Air Force Special Tactics groups such as Pararescue, Combat Control, and Special Reconnaissance, among others. Currently fielded LEP solutions reduce visual acuity due to either low visible light transmission levels and heavy tinting, or low durability. Thus, special operators refuse to wear them in theatre, especially during dawn, dusk and night missions. This puts the operators at risk, and can result in permanent and debilitating retinal damage. A high clarity, colorless LEP that is durable enough for rugged use, with a wide angular range of protection would increase user acceptance and usage, resulting in reduced occurrence of eye injuries. Eclipse has an LEP spectacle technology tailored to block NIR and other laser threats in multiple wavelengths bands while providing high transmittance and color neutrality in the visible spectrum, and providing unprecedented durability for coatings of its kind."

This is exactly the process used for DPAL.\u00a0Two years ago, we developed a whole new class of laser with ultra-high spectral brightness that improves performance by a factor of ten.

We will deliver a second 3kW package to our customer at the Center for Directed Energy of the Air Force Institute of Technology.\u00a0With an additional million-dollar, twelve-month option, we will assemble a 20kW module, recreate our DPAL gas circulator, and demonstrate for our customers one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful, DPAL in the world."

        "Abstract": "Flawless Photonics proposes the use of an innovative, Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS), Technical Readiness Level\u20137 (TRL-7) Laser Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)SpaceFiber\u2122technology solution that uses a beam of laser light to illuminate a target and detect the reflection to determine range to that target similar to RADAR but using light instead of radio waves. Widely used in autonomous automobiles, LiDARcan construct a 3D image of the surroundings by sweeping the beam creating scan lines with simple point reflections representing pixels and Time of Flight (TOF) being used to determine distance and motion, and finally computer processing being used to integrate the data into a composite image. RADAR is ubiquitous in its use to track airborne objects out to great distances by bouncing radio waves of various frequencies off those objects and measuring the return. However, RADAR has limitations in its ability to track small objects made of materials that do not reflect radio waves well, such as small drones made of wood, plastic, or composites, or stealth vehicles specifically designed to absorb or deflect RADAR.Because of radars relatively long wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum, the angular size (physical object size combined with the distance to the target) of a target is limited making the early detection of small plastic drones, for example, problematic. What is needed is a remote sensor that is capable of detecting small objects under 2m in size out to distances of 50Km or more, rapidly and if possible, characterize the object to identify threats.\u00a0 LiDAR is also now a ubiquitous technology used for ranging, mapping, autonomous vehicles, and many other applications with the ability to create 3D models of the environment around the light or laser source.Using a variety of methods to emit and detect laser pulses, information such as range, speed, and shape of objects are able to be determined with great accuracy. However modern LiDARs do have limitations that hold them back from being used to detect and target aerial objects and threats including beam size, power,range, eye safety, and others.Flawless Photonics leverages their SpaceFiber\u2122to create fiber lasers in the mid-infrared spectrum capable of producing a LiDAR system with the ability to accurately detect, range, and characterize objects of any materialas small as 2 meters out to distances of 50Km or more"

        "Abstract": "We recently demonstrated that broadband diode laser arrays can be configured to receive feedback through an atomic line filter (ALF), locking their wavelength and concentrating their spectral power within the narrow absorption profile of rubidium vapor, a one-hundred-fold improvement. We accomplished this, however with a bulky imaging system. During this Phase I project, we will implement a new prototype pump laser architecture that achieves spectral locking via an ALF without the need for the imaging system. This technology will reduce size and complexity of our existing world-class commercial systems for producing hyperpolarized xenon, an inhalable agent for imaging pulmonary function, as well as reducing SWaP for a scalable directed energy weapon. If awarded a Phase II continuation, we will assemble and optimize a 15kW pump laser module, mate it with our proprietary flowing-curtain gas circulator system, and demonstrate a diffraction limited DPAL beam. Although DPAL development programs are underway within the Air Force, our innovation unleashes a cascade of benefits over those efforts, including total absorption of the pump beam at modest gas temperatures, lowered cavity heat load, elimination of chemical cracking of the hydrocarbon quenching-agent, instant time-to-firing (no warm-up transient), and a low-risk power-scaling path to megawatt levels."

        "Abstract": "The US Air Force is undertaking process improvements for bonded repairs on C-130 aircraft wings.\u00a0 These repairs are both composite and metal patches which are bonded to the wing surfaces primarily at points where corrosion, gouges, or other surface damage has been removed.\u00a0 Patch materials are commonly boron fiber epoxy pre-impregnated composite and titanium with high temperature epoxy film adhesive.\u00a0 The intention of the patches is to recover the strength lost from material removal. These patch repairs save hundreds of millions of dollars in repair by eliminating the need to complete a full component replacement. Present process control emphasizes surface preparation as the primary means of controlling repair quality and bond strength.\u00a0 To date, thermographic inspection is the only means, aside from visual inspection, that is used to judge the quality of the bonded repair patch installations.\u00a0 This is only done at the initial patch installation since this method requires heating of the patch and is perceived as posing a risk for degradation of patches that have seen flight service.\u00a0 Review of historic inspection data indicates that patch delamination occurs frequently enough that inspection process improvement may result in a net reduction of maintenance hours expended.\u00a0 The current nondestructive inspection techniques involving ultrasonic inspection are not capable of determining bond strength for certification of bonded structures, limiting bonded joint acceptance for critical structures like composite patch repairs. Two USAF organizations have interest in bonded repair process improvement.\u00a0 The C-130 SPO is the operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness (OSS&amp;E) authority for the fleet.\u00a0 Engineers from this organization are responsible for assuring that bonded repair application will result in continued safe aircraft operation and that maintenance on the repaired areas is minimized.\u00a0 AFLCMC\/CMXG is the maintenance organization that employs specified processes for initial damage removal, bonded patch installation, initial and periodic inspections, and rework or replacement when required.\u00a0 Laser Bond Inspection (LBI) is potentially beneficial to both of these groups since the anticipated gain in initial bonded patch quality would serve to enhance overall aircraft safety and minimize rework at the point of patch installation as well as reducing patch replacement, since patch integrity could conceivably be nondestructively determined. The investments made by Industry and Government to generate data and build the various LBI system components to conduct this inspection process can be leveraged to support this proposed Phase I for maturation and implementation for the inspection of bonded composite patch repairs.\u00a0 LBI can be used to validate the integrity of repairs that are made to either a metallic or composite aircraft by identifying weak bonded repairs and to detect the presence of \u201ckissing bonds."

        "Abstract": "To maintain safe operation, aircraft are carefully inspected at regular intervals, or as needed. These inspections are time-consuming and pose risks to both people and aircraft as heavy machinery at considerable heights are involved. Aircraft operators, both defense and commercial, are increasingly considering using small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS or \u201cdrones\u201d) to fly around the aircraft and collect imagery to facilitate inspection of aircraft skin damage. Near Earth has developed a commercial sUAS prototype and autonomously navigated it around a C-17 aircraft to exhaustively image its upper-facing fuselage and wing surfaces in less than 15 minutes of flying.\u00a0 The UAS uses our award-winning, real-time, high precision laser-visual odometry and mapping technology for navigation. Therefore, the UAS navigates in unstructured environment with no need for any external infrastructure for positioning and navigation.\u00a0\u00a0 The operation is fully autonomous: the drone takes off, locates the airplane to be inspected, navigates around it to collect images, and lands at the take-off location autonomously.\u00a0 The autonomy provides for two critical aspects: 1) safety \u2013 an autonomous UAS is guided much more precisely than with manual flight,\u00a0 and 2) ability to tag images with positional information \u2013 the UAS knows exactly where each picture is taken from and what areas on the aircraft the images are looking at.\u00a0 In addition, the autonomous flight can be relatively fast, thus extending the aircraft coverage for a given UAS endurance.\u00a0 An operator monitors the performance of the drone through a live graphical user interface on the ground station (a laptop or a tablet).\u00a0 The collected images are analyzed by human inspectors or automated defect detection algorithms.\u00a0 The images and\/or semantically labeled defects are stored for later reference or future comparison. With the stringent pace of flight schedules in both commercial and defense sector, aircraft down-time costs accumulate significantly. This proposal requests funding to develop the business case of UAS-based military aircraft inspection through engagement with and flight demonstration to multiple Air Force units.\u00a0 It is expected that both Air Force and Near Earth will learn and benefit from this direct exchange leading to product requirements tuned to specific Air Force concepts of operations, increased safety, greater \u201cup-time\u201d, and reduced costs.\u00a0 Applications to civilian aircraft inspection are straightforward as they follow similar inspection patterns."

        "Abstract": "The US Air Force maintains an active fleet of 5,000+ aircraft, with an average age of 28 years in service. The US Military has more than 10,000 aircraft and spends an estimated $4 Billion annually to support these critical weapon systems. One considerable cost is replacement of expensive engine components such as turbine blades that cost $1,000\u2019s per part.\u00a0 Adoption of repair technologies that enable the restoration of worn components by adding material back onto the part to return it to original spec \u2013 without sacrificing mechanical properties, is desired. Such repair technologies are much more economical than new make replacement parts, in some cases saving as much as 70%. Wire-based manual welding - including tungsten inert gas (TIG) - is widely used for turbine blades; however, there are many issues with such a manual process, including:\u00a0 Low resolution process compared with thin-walled blades. Risks damaging the part through excessive heat input. Requires significant post-processing to achieve final form. Manual welders aging out, projected shortage of 450,000 by 2022. Conversely, a transition to a proven micro-welding solution technology called Laser Cladding, also known as Directed Energy Deposition (DED) in the Additive Manufacturing (AM) world is needed. Key advantages that make DED more suitable to automation include: Computer-controlled process that is highly repeatable. Computer-controlled motion that ensures extremely high positional precision. Low Heat-Affected Zone (HAZ) that will not damage the blade. Weld is a fraction the size of TIG, requiring less post-processing In other words, DED\/Cladding is a fundamentally more predictable, repeatable and precision process that enables the higher yields necessary to support any automation strategy. Furthermore, from a financial standpoint, based on consultation with existing users doing production repair in the gas turbine space, the payback period for a DED\/Cladding machine is less than 2 years with an ROI of 187%."

To realize the full potential of LPBF to meet anticipated needs of the defense industrial base, advances in LPBF systems are needed, to include larger build envelopes, faster build rate, improved quality control, and decreased cost. Key enablers to achieve these goals include multi-laser LPBF platforms with integrated process monitoring sensors, analytics, and feedback control capabilities. The purpose of this effort is to develop a prototype open-architecture LPBF system with integrated process monitoring and demonstrated feedback control, to serve as a test bed for multi-laser research and production platform for large parts (up to 24&quot; x 24&quot; x 12&quot;). The effort builds on past work successfully transitioning open-architecture single laser systems and sensing solutions from Phase I all the way through TRL-9."

        "Abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is an increasingly important process for additive manufacturing (AM) of metallic parts for aerospace and defense. To realize the full potential of LPBF to meet anticipated needs of the defense industrial base, advances in LPBF systems are needed, to include larger build envelopes, faster build rate, improved quality control, and decreased cost. Key enablers to achieve these goals include multi-laser LPBF platforms with integrated process monitoring sensors, analytics, and feedback control capabilities. The purpose of this effort is to develop a prototype open-architecture LPBF system with integrated process monitoring and demonstrated feedback control, to serve as a test bed for multi-laser research and production platform for large parts (up to 24&quot; x 24&quot; x 12&quot;). The effort builds on past work successfully transitioning open-architecture single laser systems and sensing solutions from Phase I all the way through TRL-9."

We will work to develop a means of measuring a laser beam direction from outside the beam path that exploits single photon detectors (SPDs). SPDs are the most sensitive detectors possible, especially when multi-spatial mode receivers are employed to capture the maximum amount of scattered light. Prototype systems will be built and tested. In addition to the beam directionality these systems should also be capable of deriving information about the data transmitted such as the data modulation rate or even in some conditions the actual data bits."

        "Abstract": "Laser forming is a process that doesn\u2019t strictly fall into the category of either additive or subtractive manufacturing.\u00a0 While 3D Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology has had some success in fabricating antennas, there have been various drawbacks limiting performance. For direct-write antennas, antenna performance has been somewhat limited because the resistivity achieved so far with nanoparticle inks is 2-4 times the resistivity of bulk metals. Antennas have also been fabricated by laser powder bed technology, but this technology requires an appreciable investment in equipment, has health issues associated with powders, and some fabricated antennas have exhibited roughness that can impact performance whereby a post-process machining step is required. When combined with laser cutting and welding, the recent work by ARL in laser folding and origami metal working opens up new possibilities for manufacturing antennas using a variety of sheet metals with high fabrication precision and bulk metal conductivity, as required for mm-wave antennas. Millimeter wave antennas require small features because the free-space wavelength is on the order of a few millimeters (f=30-300 GHz \u00ab l =10-1mm). \u00a0In addition to bending\/forming by CW or nanosecond pulse lasers, femtosecond laser pulses can be used for high precision milling, cutting, and micro-adjustments. We propose to determine a library of laser\/beamforming parameters to enable laser forming, cutting, and welding of copper, steel, aluminum, and brass. Fortunately, for laser forming and welding, we will not be starting from scratch on this effort because there are already numerous reports in the literature on laser forming, both experimental and modelling. \u00a0We also propose to incorporate this library into our DDM-1 ecosystem that includes COTS software with a sheet metal CAD\/CAM function as well as laser-toolpath generation; explore the technical merit of laser-forming fabrication of millimeter wave and sub millimeter wave antennas; design and simulate mm-wave and s-mm-wave antennas; fabricate proof-of concept antennas and collaborate with a government partner for evaluation; and move to identify a commercialization roadmap - both within and without our DDM-1 system (we believe within is straight-forward). Our DDM-1 system enables rapid development of the process to allow the antenna technology developer to move a design from a computational electromagnetic modeling tool to our CAD\/CAM system for controlling the laser for bending, cutting, and welding. This facilitates rapid on-site prototyping of conformal and non-conformal antennas. For proof of concept in Phase I, we will design, simulate, and laser-fabricate a shunt slot array antenna at S or C band to demonstrate basic capability. For proof of concept in the Phase I option period, we will develop 5-axis fabrication processes and fabricate a 3D conical sinuous antenna."

Stottler Henke\u2019s SCOUT, based on several existing mature technologies, and previously demonstrated on actual flying UAVs, completely autonomously creates path plans and automatically reacts to found targets by performing additional path planning as necessary. Furthermore, SCOUT can allocate search areas for individual UAVs based on their individual capabilities (in sensing and mobility) and autonomously plan around recently detected threats. Tactics also exist for employing multiple UAVs against a single target simultaneously. SCOUT is a general architecture that can be easily applied to different mission types and in Phase I, we will adapt SCOUT to electronic warfare domain, specifically in the A2AD environment. Missions will include deception\/seduction of enemy sensors and penetration and suppression of IADS (similar to the SEAD mission which SCOUT has been proven to be effective with), which requires adapting and developing new AI techniques to automate all aspects of intelligently, automatically selecting appropriate plays, robustly assigning roles and planning routes, and adaptively executing each role, robustly and predictably in diverse environments, including intelligent information sharing.\u00a0 The existing SCOUT architecture provides an already-flight-tested and proven foundation for the development of the proposed EW-SCOUT. \u00a0EW-SCOUT will enable fully autonomous UAS EW-related missions in the A2AD environment, allowing for allied manned aircraft to more safely penetrate the airspace. We will design the ultimate system and, to prove its feasibility, prototype all aspects of it in Phase I based on our current SCOUT architecture and demonstrate it with our already-existing Multi-Agent SimulaTor (MAST). MAST is able to simulate the movement of air and ground forces, factoring in environmental variables such as terrain and weather and executes Monte-Carlo-styled scenarios. It is capable of simulating UAV detection and tracking via sensors, human and mechanical, and communications over a variety of different technologies\u00a0(e.g., visual, radar, IR, acoustic). In Phase I, we plan to make improvements to the communications feature of MAST to include new technologies such as low-energy lasers and to expand the set of DIL environment behaviors. We will also investigate integration with possible ALE platforms, representative sensors, and UAVs, supported by a group of highly qualified subject matter experts in\u00a0EW operations."

ATHENA is a compact, lightweight, low cost sensor that provides hemispherical coverage for early warning detection and tracking multiple threats. It interfaces with the platform\u2019s high-power laser. ATHENA\u2019s innovative system design and algorithms provide (a) a system with a platform-agnostic, low-size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) design that provides hemispherical coverage for early warning detection and (b) a device with large computational capability within a small form-factor that consumes low power, which is sufficient to detect, identify, and track threats with a low false alarm rate using radar cross-section data. In Phase I, POC will design ATHENA and develop a limited-scale benchtop hardware with modeling, simulation, or laboratory experimentation to show the efficacy of the concept design. In Phase II, POC will fabricate, test, and evaluate a field ready, technology readiness level (TRL)-5\/6, platform-mounted ATHENA with threat detection capability that can be demonstrated to a suitable customer for further transition."

        "Abstract": "AeroMancer Technologies proposes to develop a Dome Lidar system for hemispherical early warning detection and tracking of threats using a compact, eye-safe infrared active electro-optic sensor. Current early warning detection systems are radar-based and are too large to be deployed on the same platform where laser-based countermeasures are installed. Our proposed method for achieving hemispherical coverage is by using a narrow field-of-view multi-aperture lidar beam that is scanned along two axis to attain full coverage at the requested track rate of 10 Hz. In Phase I, we will analyze the measurement requirements in detail and translate them into the functional requirements of a compact sensor that can meet the SWaP requirements to be installed on\u00a0a deployed platform. We will develop a lidar performance simulation tool using a numerical model of the lidar and use it to perform trade studies. Using the requirements analysis and performance simulations, we will develop a conceptual design of the proposed system. We will develop the preliminary design of a detection and tracking algorithm to extract position and velocity of the incoming target from lidar data."

        "Abstract": "Thermal blooming is a major nonlinear effect for high energy laser (HEL) beams propagating through the atmosphere. Due to this effect, the beam pattern is distorted through the propagation path, thus limiting the maximum power that can be efficiently transmitted through the atmosphere. There is a critical need to accurately predict thermal blooming for military applications. \u00a0Although some methods have been suggested for compensating thermal blooming using phase conjugation akin to adaptive optics, there is usually a critical power beyond which the phase conjugation does not lead to increased power on target. \u00a0For this effort, we propose using a dual-frequency comb (DFC) system for near infrared absorption spectroscopy to make predictions on thermal blooming in various outdoor\/turbulence environments. Due to a fast scan rate, the DFC system will be less immune to turbulence. By putting the DFC system in situ with the HEL, we can in principle measure the absorption prior to engaging the target and predict whether the HEL will be effective or not based on the absorption measurements."

Frequency stabilized laser oscillators are critical tools in many cutting-edge experiments.\u00a0 From tests of general relativity and variation of fundamental constants, to development of better quantum sensors, a laser locked to a high finesse Fabry-Perot cavity is a crucial part of many devices.\u00a0 Improved performance from atomic clocks, including a reduction in size, weight, and power (SWaP) allows huge advances in many fields. Ultimately, cryogenic silicon cavity systems would be suited to replacing conventional hydrogen masers.\u00a0 The short-term stability (sampling times of less than 10 seconds) of a cryogenic silicon laser would be a factor of 100 better than a maser.\u00a0 Because of silicon\u2019s low drift nature, it would continue to outperform a maser to long time scales.\u00a0 The potential market for replacing masers is immense.

        "Abstract": "High energy lasers (HELs) are in great demand for industrial material processing and directed energy weapon systems for defense and security. Compared to other laser platforms, fiber lasers have shown their excellence in producing high beam quality and high brightness HELs by taking advantages of their inherent attractive aspects including optical confinement in glass fibers, compactness, robust operation, easy thermal management, high power scalability, alignment-free operation, and low maintenance. Most kW-class HELs in development today are based on Yb3+-doped silica glass fiber lasers operating around 1 \u00b5m wavelength because of their high optical efficiency. But 1 \u00b5m lasers are neither eye-safe nor highly transparent in the atmosphere, which have severely restrained their in-field applications.\u00a0 2 \u00b5m lasers are preferred over 1 mm and 1.5 \u00b5m lasers for long-range applications including direct energy laser weapon, LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) and sensing systems, and direct optical communication because atmospheric scattering, atmospheric distortion, and thermal blooming are significantly reduced by operating at longer wavelengths. \u00a0NP Photonics is a pioneer in the design and fabrication of highly doped optical fibers and the development of high-performance fiber lasers at 2-micron. We propose to develop a scalable high-efficiency high-atmospheric-transparency HEL source based on spectrally combined Ho-doped germanate fiber lasers at 2.1-micron that are in-band pumped by Tm-doped fiber lasers at 1950 nm."

        "Abstract": "This proposal addresses, for the first time, the demonstration of integrated mid-infrared sources based on waveguiding in a bonded solid-state laser material and periodically poled nonlinear material. A focused femtosecond laser beam allows for precisely localized modification of the refractive index of a material, therefore enabling to create waveguiding structures. The offeror has demonstrated femtosecond-laser-inscribed singlemode waveguide in Nd:YAG with record-low propagation loss of 0.2dB\/cm. The inscription technique was optimized by their comprehensive numerical modeling ability. nbsp;A single continuous waveguide will be inscribed in a laser-bonded Nd:YAG substrate and a periodically poled crystal, then integrated with a tunable laser in the near infrared. The resulting small mode size leads to efficient lasing in the laser material and efficient difference frequency generation via nonlinear wavemixing in the periodically poled element. This will enable the manufacturing of compact, tunable, mid-infrared laser sources with excellent spectral and spatial quality and low size, weight and power for NASA and non-NASA applications.The targeted range of wavelengths, between 3 and 5 micrometers, corresponds to absorption lines of several functional groups, and the tunable monochromatic mid-infrared source can therefore be integrated in a large range of instruments that monitor species such as formaldehyde, methane, ethylene, carbon and nitrogen oxides, by absorption spectroscopy. The developed architecture is also compatible with sum-frequency generation, allowing the development of tunable sources in the visible. The proposed technology enables the ultimate 3D fabrication of integrated photonics circuits via combining passive and active media such as waveguide lasers, detectors, modulators, and optical interconnects. The offeror has attracted $2.3 million financial commitment from Coherent, Toptica, etc for joint development\/support of the proposed technology."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project is to develop an accessible, rapid, low-cost method to discover and create new high-performance alloys; these alloys could potentially be tailored to specific applications by additive manufacturing. Currently, alloy development and part manufacturing often utilize a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; approach allowing for limited alloy customization. In most cases, where new materials are created to increase performance, costs can be prohibitive. Metal additive manufacturing disrupts such conventions, creating opportunities for manufacturing low-volume, niche parts, but still material options remain limited. A new approach could enable a suite of specialized high-performance alloys that directly scales to functional parts, for use by companies of all sizes. This proposal aims to develop the necessary tools and implement this approach to create a new copper-based alloy targeting the injection molding industry to significantly reduce part production times. This Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will develop a novel sample evaluation method to discover and create new metal alloys for laser-based additive manufacturing processes. The effort will utilize low-cost, rapid testing techniques to evaluate alloy chemistries on a laboratory scale so that the processing-structure-properties relationships can be determined for direct scale up in an additive manufacturing framework. The chemistry selection will utilize thermodynamic modeling and simulation, low-cost test coupon generation, and a rapid experimental procedure to simulate the thermal history experienced in laser powder bed fusion, allowing for both reduced experimentation timelines and direct feedback into process models for validation and improving accuracy. The method will be validated by creating a novel copper-based alloy with improved strength and thermal conductivity over the current state-of-the-art. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "This project seeks to demonstrate a new approach for implementing tunable mid-infrared (IR) ultrafast lasers at high peak-and average powers, to specifically address the need outlined in Topic 32: Laser Technology R&amp;D for Accelerators, listed under \u201cType III.\u201d This category seeks to develop ultrafast lasers in the 2-5 micron mid-infrared (IR) spectral range with energies in the mJ- J range, repetition-rates approaching 1 MHz, sub-50 fs pulse duration, and wallplug efficiency ~20%. Here, we propose a novel and disruptive approach to implement an efficient, compact, and robust ultrafast laser, in a project compatible with an STTR budget but using an approach that can be scaled to meet the Type III criteria. Coherent combination of fiber lasers has become a popular approach for scaling of ultrafast lasers, but suffers from a number of technical shortcomings. Furthermore, that approach is only efficient and implemented to-date for near-IR pulse generation. We propose an alternate approach which integrates beam combining and frequency conversion into the mid-IR. By using multiple fiber lasers\u2014operating in the most energy-efficient, long-pulse regime\u2014to pump a frequency conversion step employing optical parametric chirped pulse amplification (OPCPA), we can make a simple and robust mid-IR laser. This OPCPA scheme is based on chirped pulse amplification (2018 Nobel Prize in Physics), where a low-energy seed pulse is first stretched in time, and sent into an optical amplifier, and subsequently recompressed. The use of periodically poled (PP) nonlinear crystals for the OPCPA step makes it possible to straightforwardly implement multibeam pumping in a way that coherently combines the energy from these beams with no need for interferometric stability. This provides an elegant and compact approach for implementing high-energy mid-IR ultrafast lasers. Moreover, this approach can allow for 70% conversion efficiency in the fiber laser amplification, and 30% in the frequency conversion step, exceeding the efficiency, pulse duration, and tunability characteristics of alternative direct mid-IR amplification schemes\u2014with the potential for scaling to multi-kW output. It is also ideal for high repetition-rate operation in the ~"

A key component in an HEL AO system is the deformable mirror (DM). However, mechanical constraints in currently available DMs limits AO system performance in stressing engagements. Guidestar teamed with UCLA to develop methods that can provide AO performance with a constrained DM that is comparable to performance with an ideal DM that does not have these physical constraints. Guidestar developed a conjugate gradient method that determined an optimal DM command without violating hardware limitations in a woofer-tweeter control architecture. This method tied together within an adaptive Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework developed by UCLA. In this proposed Phase II program, Guidestar and UCLA will advance the development of these approaches, creating a complete control architecture to provide optimal AO correction using a DM that is constrained by total stroke saturation and inter-actuator stroke limits. Our approach will be validated through modeling and simulation, as well as scaled laboratory testing of the DM control methods."

        "Abstract": "Under this STTR program, QuesTek Innovations LLC will utilize its knowledge and expertise in Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) to develop improved part-scale, metal-based additive manufacturing (AM) process models, focusing on thermal history and grain growth prediction. QuesTek will partner with Professor Gregory Wagner at Northwestern University, who has expertise in modeling the thermal history of AM processes. The expertise of the Wagner Research Group will combine with QuesTekrsquo;s knowledge on microstructural prediction to implement improvements to part-scale simulations of AM processes to predict grain structure, which will enable prediction of component-level microstructural anisotropy.Phase I efforts will focus on research and development of methodologies for improving the accuracy and efficiency of higher-scale AM simulations regarding laser powder bed fusion of Inconel 625. Methodologies will begin from the well-established single-track simulations, moving to multi-layer simulations, and finally starting to formulate and develop methodologies for addressing efficiency concerns of simulations at the part-scale by using reduced-order models calibrated by higher accuracy models. The efforts of the Wagner Research Group will synergize with and improve QuesTekrsquo;s efforts, as accurate thermal history predictions are imperative for accurate grain growth predictions, while QuesTekrsquo;s efforts will help further validate the Wagner Grouprsquo;s work.Phase II efforts would focus on further developing methodologies to achieve more efficient and accurate part-scale AM simulations. In tandem with the algorithm development, an emphasis would be placed on further part-scale validation studies. These studies would be used both for calibrating and validating the methods for different AM processing parameter ranges, to extend the versatility and robustness of the tools developed"

        "Abstract": "Dual Excitation Catheter-delivered Laser Ultrasound Thrombolysis (DECLUT) for Deep VeinThrombosis (DVT) TreatmentDeep-vein thrombosis (DVT), or the formation of clots in the deep veins of the legs, affects\ntwo million Americans per year. DVT can cause pulmonary embolism (PE), which is fatal in andgt;0.1\nmillion cases annually in the US alone, presents as sudden death in 20-25% of cases. Recent\ninnovative DVT treatment techniques, such as pharmacological dissolution or fibrinolysis,\nmechanical fragmentation and sonothrombolysis, showed progressive results. However, the low\nthrombolysis efficiency, vein injury associated severe regional dysfunction, the relatively large\nsize of clot debris, risk of recurrent and distal embolism are key limitations for effective DVT\ntreatments. More recently, research on ultrasound thrombolysis using multifrequency ultrasound\nexcitations, combined continuous wave and laser ultrasound excitations, and excitations using\nmicrobubbles (MBs) showed promising lytic rate, but these demonstrated methods used\ntransducers with relatively large aperture and are not applicable to integrated catheter for\nintravascular thrombolysis. In this project, a dual excitation catheter-delivered laser ultrasound\nthrombolysis (DECLUT) technology is proposed to address the existing challenges in DVT\ntreatments. In specific, a 7-French catheter integrated with a small aperture dual frequency high\nintensity ultrasound transducer, a laser ultrasound transducer, and a micro-tube for delivery of\nMBs and lytic agent (t-PA) will be designed, prototyped and characterized, followed by in-vitro\nand ex-vivo thrombolysis tests. With the proposed technique, fast clot dissolution can be expected\nbecause of the use of MBs and the dual-ultrasound excitation; safe clot-dissolving can be\nachieved due to the minimal use of lytic agent, the reduced physical contact to the target clot and\nthe minimal acoustic exposure of the surrounding vessel wall.The proposed DECLUT technology provides a new tool enabling physicians in more accurate,\nfast and safe DVT treatment, and facilitating the development of novel intravascular drugs and\ndevice therapies. In addition to DVT treatments and other intravascular thrombolysis, the\nproposed DECLUT technique will be also be useful in minimal invasive cancer treatment and\ntargeted drug delivery.Narrative\nDeep-vein thrombosis (DVT), or the formation of clots in the deep veins of the legs, affects two\nmillion Americans per year. DVT induced pulmonary embolism (PE) is one of the leading cause\nof mortality and morbidity \u2013 yet technologies for fast and safe DVT and PE treatment are critically\nlacking. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a new and effective DVT treatment using dual\nexcitation catheter-delivered laser ultrasound thrombolysis (DECLUT). DECLUT technology\nprovides a new tool enabling rapid and safe PE treatments and other intravascular thrombolysis,\nand has the potential to have a significant impact on minimal invasive tumor treatments and\ntargeted drug delivery."

        "Abstract": "We have developed a novel low-cost, multi-functional blood coagulation sensor that can measure a patient\u2019s coagulation status within less than 10 minutes using a 25mL drop of blood. This device addresses the critical unmet need to identify and manage patients with an elevated risk of life-threatening bleeding or thrombosis, the major causes of in-hospital preventable death. In addition, our innovation will enable rapid coagulation testing in the home or primary care setting for over 15 million patients worldwide who routinely receive oral anticoagulants to prevent venous and arterial thrombosis, the world\u2019s number one killer. Coagulation testing at the point of care is currently the fastest growing segment of the in vitro blood diagnostics market, with nearly $2 billion in global annual sales. Driven by the immediate need for improved blood product utilization and the rapidly growing numbers of patients receiving anti-coagulants worldwide, the coagulation testing industry is expected to burgeon by nearly 10-fold over the next decade. The blood coagulation sensor described in this proposal is well positioned to have a significant competitive advantage over other point of care coagulation devices. This is because current devices can only measure clotting time and often fail to identify the underlying coagulation defect. As a result, additional time-consuming laboratory tests are yet performed to assess relevant parameters: clot rate, fibrinogen, and fibrinolysis parameters, to reveal the underlying cause of bleeding or thrombosis. Current mechanical viscoelastic assays such as thromboelastography (TEG) can quantify these parameters in real-time; however, due to high cost, large size, complex operation and large blood volumes, these devices are unsuitable for use at the patient\u2019s bedside. Our proposed coagulation sensor uniquely combines the strengths of a low-cost, palm-sezed module with the capability to quantify multiple relevant coagulation parameters required to diagnose the underlying coagulation defect within a fraction of the time and at the cost of current devices. Our approach, we term integrated coagulation laboratory (iCoagLab), involves placing a drop of blood in a 3-channel, disposable cartridge. A laser source, similar to a common laser pointer illuminates the blood sample and a small camera images laser speckle patterns reflected from the sample over time. By analyzing laser speckle intensity fluctuations in real-time, we can measure the viscoelastic properties of blood during coagulation and recover information about multiple coagulation metrics within minutes. iCoagLab\u2019s capabilities for comprehensive coagulation profiling at the bedside will have major clinical impact in identifying patients at high risk of bleeding or thrombosis, tailoring blood transfusion and anti-coagulation protocols, and monitoring hemostasis during therapy to improve patient outcome."

The technologically important material properties of diamond are of significant interest for development of electron emission, detector, and wide-bandgap semiconductor applications, including radiation-hard devices. A diamond amplifier cathode concept has been proposed to generate such high average current electron beams. Experiments have already demonstrated the potential to generate amplified electron beams from diamond with peak current density greater than 400 mA per square mm and average current density larger than 100 mA per square mm. However, the concept is still to be fully developed and tested in accelerator cavities. Moreover, the optimal surface preparation is still to be determined. We propose to address this problem by fabrication of diamond amplifier samples with different surface properties, experimental testing, and high-fidelity modeling to assist the experimental work."

        "Abstract": "The ever-growing need for high-data rate, low-latency, secure, wireless communications driven by applications ranging from vehicle automation to ad-hoc battlefield command and control necessitate free space communication links (FSCLs) operating outside of the regulated and crowded rf-frequency bands. Intraband and NRL, working with the UW-Madison as the STTR Research Partner, propose to investigate the feasibility of FSCLs based on the UW\/Intraband 2.5-W MOCVD-grown QCL technology and the NRL resonant-cavity infrared detectors (RCIDs) when optimized for modulation bandwidth &gt; 5 GHz, transmitter power &gt; 1 W, narrow linewidth, and link signal to noise ratio. The RCID resonant cavity reduces the absorber thickness required to achieve high quantum efficiency in the detector. This reduced thickness reduces the dark current, increases specific detectivity, and decreases carrier transit time. The ~ 50-nm optical bandwidth of the RCID also aids in rejecting background radiation but requires a QCL with narrow linewidth. Intraband will work with the UW Madison to design and model high-power, narrow-linewidth QCLs optimized for high-speed modulation. NRL will investigate the feasibility of &gt; 5-GHz bandwidth for a MWIR RCID and provide modeled device characteristics for devices and arrays. Intraband will develop a link model with projected performance based on simulated device characteristics."

        "Abstract": "A Directed Energy (DE) system able to remotely disrupt packaged electronics in a realistic target in less than a few milliseconds are of interest, especially if the solution may be scaled to neutralize targets more than 1 km away. The long dwell times as well as high electrical and cooling requirements associated with high power microwave and continuous wave (CW) laser systems restrict their deployment in the field. In contrast, with ultra-short pulsed systems, the interaction between a laser pulse and a material can generate localized RF radiation to disrupt nearby electronics in a single-shot strategy thereby reducing the dwell time to less than a millisecond. Applied Energetics, Inc. (hereafter, AE) and the University of Central Florida (hereafter, UCF) have recently made significant progress in exploring a new paradigm of ultrafast laser filamentation propagation and interaction science. In particular, the properties of phase modified filament generation open a venue for ultrafast filament interaction at distances of a kilometer or more. In experiments in the lab at short-intermediate ranges, we have seen significant RF, microwave and acoustic generation effects produced in this filamentation regime for the disruption of electronic devices."

A key component in an HEL AO system is the deformable mirror (DM). However, mechanical constraints in currently available DMs limits AO system performance in stressing engagements. Guidestar teamed with UCLA to develop methods that can provide AO performance with a constrained DM that is comparable to performance with an ideal DM that does not have these physical constraints. Guidestar developed a conjugate gradient method that determined an optimal DM command without violating hardware limitations in a woofer-tweeter control architecture. This method tied together within an adaptive Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework developed by UCLA. In this proposed Phase II program, Guidestar and UCLA will advance the development of these approaches, creating a complete control architecture to provide optimal AO correction using a DM that is constrained by total stroke saturation and inter-actuator stroke limits. Our approach will be validated through modeling and simulation, as well as scaled laboratory testing of the DM control methods."

        "Abstract": "Naturally occurring periodic nanostructures have long been of interest due to their striking optical effects and potential biological roles. They have been recognized not only as interesting curiosities but potential design inspirations that can lead to improvements in biochemical sensors, laser surgery, photovoltaics, and other mission-critical applications. This work will focus on one such application of significant human safety and national security concern: chemical warfare agent (CWA) sensors inspired by naturally occurring nanophotonic structures like those of the morpho butterfly. Recent efforts on this front have concluded that naturally occurring structures offer more sensitivity than synthetic ones due to their complex periodicity. This puts our team in an advantageous position to push this effort forward: with leaders in the synthesis of spatially variant photonic crystals (SVPCs), the team brings expertise in one of the most promising techniques to generate complex structures incorporating spatially variant period, randomness, and other naturally occurring features; these structures can then be fabricated by multi-photon lithography (MPL), where the team offers a pioneer and internationally recognized leader in the field\u00a0in its application for creating functional 3D nanophotonic devices. This work aims to support the development of practical, field-deployable sensors based on artificial substrates inspired by nanophotonic structures found in nature. The proposed tasks will develop fundamental knowledge and engineering design principles to support this effort. First, to determine the fabrication limits of MPL, a range of peacock-feather-inspired SVPCs will be fabricated to systematically and randomly vary in fill-factor extremes. Next, SVPCs will be fabricated to incorporate periodic \u201ctree-like\u201d structures that imbue the morpho butterfly with its unusual structural coloration properties. Leveraging the knowledge generated in these tasks, large-area bioinspired SVPCs will be fabricated to extend the development of novel chemical sensors based on nanoparticle-decorated morpho butterfly wings and other natural photonic crystals. All tasks will be accompanied by modeling and simulation efforts to validate and broaden the design space."

        "Abstract": "Project SummaryCataract, the clouding of the eye lens is responsible for 51% of world blindness. According to World\nHealth Organization nearly 18 million people are bilaterally blind from cataracts in the world. Cataract is easily\ntreated by surgery and is considered as one of the most cost-effective interventions. Although cataract surgery\nis generally considered to be safe, there are significant complications: (i) 30-50% of patients in the US having\ncataract surgery develop opacification of the posterior lens capsule within two years and require laser\ntreatment; (ii) 0.8% have retinal detachments; (iii) 0.6-1.3% are hospitalized for corneal edema or require\ncorneal transplantation and (iv) about 1% are presented with endophthalmitis. In addition, in many remote and\npoor areas of the developing and under-developed regions of the world, people still remain blind from cataracts,\nprimarily due to lack of access to eye care. As a result of which, cataract related blindness is as high as 50% or\nmore in poor and remote regions of the world compared to only 5% in developed countries. Alpha-crystallin\n(AC) is one of the three major eye lens crystallins and is a representative member of the small heat shock\nprotein (sHsp) family. AC serves as molecular chaperone, protecting damaged or aged lens proteins and\nenzymes from aggregation that would otherwise lead to light scattering and cataract formation. It is well\nestablished that chaperone-like activity (CLA) of AC is critical for lens transparency and it is hypothesized that\nmaintaining optimal or increasing chaperone activity might aid in the prevention or slowing of cataracts. The\nrationale of our proposal is based on the observation that small molecule pharmacological agents from natural\nsources can prevent the loss of CLA of Alpha crystallin A-chain (AAC) and can delay cataract formation in\npreclinical models. It has been estimated that delaying cataracts formation by 10 years can reduce the vision\ncare expense by 50%. In addition, our preliminary data supports the hypothesis that an FDA approved drug,\ntolcapone (CAP1160) increases AAC CLA and maintains transparency of the eye lens in organ culture\nexperiments of cataract model. Therefore, the goal of our proposal is to advance the prodrug of CAP1160,\nCAP4196 through in vivo efficacy and proof of concept studies to develop a cost-effective non-surgical\ntreatment to: (i) delay the need for cataract surgery and (ii) reduce the disparity of cataract-related blindness\nglobally, and the specific aims are: Aim 1a. Design and synthesis of prodrugs of CAP1160, formulation,\nstability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Aim 1b. Establish cGMP manufacturing and formulation of lead\ncandidate prodrug CAP4196. Aim 2a. Ocular pharmacokinetics of CAP4196. Aim 2b. In vivo POC and efficacy\nof CAP4196 in dogs with age-related cataracts. Aim 3. SAR based hit-to-lead optimization of naphthalene\nseries from ex vivo efficacy through in vivo safety. Project milestone: Successful completion of these aims will\nenable CAP4196 to be advanced into clinical development.Project Narrative\nCataracts are the leading cause of blindness worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Data\ndating back to the beginning of this millennium showed that 30-60% of blindness in Africa and 60-80% in South\nEast Asia is attributable to cataracts. The only treatment currently available is surgical extraction of the lens\nand replacement with an intraocular lens that is accompanied by a high public health burden. This proposal\nprovides an innovative non-surgical approach to address this public health burden and reduce the disparity of\ncataract-related blindness globally."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIt is a rare event when new and useful medical parameters can be added to the suite of monitoring\nand diagnostic tests available in a clinical setting. Of particular importance is the ability to measure\ncrucial physiological parameters or analytes in a continuous and noninvasive manner\u2014evidenced by\nthe importance of noninvasive vital signs monitoring\u2014because it reduces expense, eliminates delays\nin diagnosis, and removes the potential for exposure to blood-borne pathogens.\nThis SBIR Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) program proposal is being submitted to further\nthe regulatory plan, intellectual property strategy, manufacturing readiness, and market launch plan\nfor a new patient monitor capable of accurate, noninvasive, and continuous measurements of total\nhemoglobin (tHb) and oxygen saturation (SpO2). The measurement of total hemoglobin is a crucial\nand frequently performed blood test used in nearly all areas of healthcare. The accurate\nmeasurement of this parameter is particularly important for patients potentially requiring a transfusion,\nreceiving rapid administration of fluids, undergoing a surgical procedure, or having experienced\ntrauma that has resulted in significant blood loss. Total hemoglobin must also be measured for\nanemia screening prior to blood donation. The new monitor will look much like a conventional pulse\noximeter, the ubiquitous vital-signs monitor that has been in widespread clinical use since the 1980s\nand which uses a clothespin-like sensor to \u201cshine\u201d red and infrared light through the finger and report\na measure of the oxygen level in the arterial blood. The product realized from the current research\nwill not only provide a noninvasive and continuous measurement of total hemoglobin but also\nnoninvasively measure oxygen saturation with unprecedented precision and accuracy.\nSuccessful completion of the proposed work will improve the commercial readiness of a pulse\noximeter capable of total hemoglobin and oxygen saturation measurements. It is the culmination of\nthe Companyandapos;s efforts to prove that the high measurement precision provided by the use of narrow-\nband lasers can make possible accurate noninvasive measurement of tHb on human subjects over\nthe full clinically-relevant tHb range. Availability of a noninvasive total hemoglobin monitor will help\ndiagnose anemic patients sooner and contribute to the judicious use of blood transfusions, all with\nless pain or risk of infection while reducing the time burden on caregivers and costs to the healthcare\nsystem. It could also eliminate the need for the painful fingersticks associated with blood donation.Narrative\nAn important part of medical care is the use of tests that help clinicians diagnose disease or other\nmedical conditions, but often these tests require that blood or other samples be drawn from the body\nand sent to a central hospital laboratory. The proposed work has the goal of creating a monitor that\ncan measure the levels of hemoglobin, the oxygen carrying protein in a patientandapos;s blood, without the\nneed to draw a blood sample. This will ease patient distress and risk of infection, speed diagnosis,\nand result in improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs."

        "Abstract": "Project Summary \/ Abstract\nCell-based assays that quantitate the effect of small molecules on cellular behavior are powerful tools in\ncancer research. The ability to assess small molecules in a physiologically relevant environment is informative,\nas the assays simultaneously evaluate compound permeability, toxicity, and potency. To date, cell-based\nassays are largely limited to measure global changes such as phenotype, proliferation, or gene expression.\nThe current challenge is to develop cell-based assays for specific enzyme activities to augment and\naccelerate drug discovery campaigns. Notably, the most common strategies for measuring enzyme\nactivities, such as radioactivity, absorbance, and fluorescent labels, often cannot be delivered to the\nappropriate target within the cellular environment and they are susceptible to high rates of false positives. This\nproposal describes the continued development and validation of a novel label-free methodology that combines\ncell culture and lysis on customized surface chemistries to allow a mass spectrometry readout for distinct\nenzyme activities. The approach uses functionalized self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) that present cell\nadhesion ligands along with substrates for the relevant cellular enzyme targets. Cells are cultured on the\nmonolayers in the presence of small molecules, and then lysed such that enzymes within the lysate have\nimmediate access to convert the immobilized substrate to a product. An advantage of using SAMs on gold is\ntheir compatibility with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS), an\napproach termed \u201cSAMDI\u201d, that records the activity of specific enzymes within the lysate. This technique,\ntermed Tandem Culture and Lysis (TCAL)-SAMDI, offers a novel, powerful tool for a quantitative readout of\nvirtually any cellular enzyme activity and represents new capabilities for high-throughput and label-free, cell-\nbased screens for drug discovery.Project Narrative\nThis proposal addresses the lack of label-free, high-throughput cell-based assays that report on specific\nenzyme activities suitable for drug discovery. The project aims to advance the development of our novel\napproach that combines cell culture and lysis on customized surface chemistries that allows, for the first time, a\nmass spectrometry readout for distinct cellular enzyme activities. We will highlight the value and flexibility of\nthis disruptive methodology by profiling substrate specificities using high density biochip arrays, developing\nnovel assays for epigenetic enzyme activities implicated in cancer, and performing a multiplex high-throughput\nscreen of 100,000 compounds to identify novel epigenetic modulators. Moreover, we will benchmark our\ntechnology against the current state-of-the-art cell-based high-throughput screening assay. Our proposal aims\nto highlight that our technology, which we intend to offer on a fee-for-service basis starting in 2022, will\ngenerate more relevant data, save companies tens of millions of dollars, and can expedite drug discovery by\ntwo years."

        "Abstract": "Most patients with melanoma die from metastatic disease as the result of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)\nspreading from a primary tumor through the blood to vital organs. Despite significant progress in the\ndevelopment of in vitro CTC-detection assays, they still have low sensitivity due to the small samples of blood\ntaken. To overcome these problems, we developed in vivo photoacoustic (PA) flow cytometry (PAFC) and\ndemonstrated its feasibility in pilot trials with melanoma patients where we used melanin in CTCs as an\nintrinsic PA contrast agent. These trials identified the key limitations of the PAFC platform, such as a stationary\nlaboratory setup with a large expensive laser, a motion- and skin-pigmentation-sensitive recording system, no\nspectral identification of melanoma CTCs in the blood background, a detection limit 20\u201330-fold lower than the\nultimate threshold, and limited clinical data. These obstacles prevent the routine use of this promising\ntechnology. The goal of our Phase I STTR proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility and clinical relevance of\nan advanced PAFC-based \u201cCytophone\u201d prototype for early, fast (from 20 sec to a few min), noninvasive (no\nblood draw), label-free (no exogenous contrast agents), and safe (no skin photodamage or blood\ncontamination concern) detection of CTCs in melanoma patients. To achieve this goal, we will optimize the\nCytophone\u2019s parameters and eventually explore its clinical capabilities during testing of melanoma patients.\nWe expect to obtain statistically significant data that will demonstrate an unprecedented 1000-fold increase in\nsensitivity, allowing us to detect 1 CTC in 1 liter of blood with our robust, wearable, and portable Cytophone\ndevice. This level of sensitivity will allow us to detect CTCs released from small tumors (e.g., \u2264 1 mm), which\nare often not identified with current diagnostic techniques. The goal of our Phase II STTR proposal is to\ndevelop commercial Cytophone prototypes to be tested in multicenter clinical trials. We expect that the\nCytophone can eventually be used in melanoma-focused clinics throughout the world for early diagnosis,\nmonitoring treatment efficiency, and as a mass melanoma screening tool (as the mammogram is used for\nbreast cancer).PROJECT NARRATIVE\nIn many cases, melanoma\u2014an aggressive malignancy reaching epidemic proportions\u2014is diagnosed only after\nbecoming untreatable. The goal of this proposal is to establish a new approach for early melanoma diagnosis\nby examining circulating tumor cells in the entire blood volume with an unprecedented 1000-fold increase in\nsensitivity. This will be accomplished with a robust, easy-to-use, portable, and wearable device called the\nCytophone. We expect it to be used broadly in melanoma-focused clinics throughout the world for early\ndisease diagnosis and evaluating treatment efficiency, as well as for mass melanoma screenings, as the\nmammogram is used for breast cancer."

        "Abstract": "Project Summary\/Abstract\nWorldwide, approximately 466 million people suffer from disabling hearing loss. When conventional hearing\naids provide no appreciable benefit, cochlear implants are a solution. Current cochlear implants, while\nbeneficial in their use, are limited in their capabilities by hand-assembly of wire-bundled electrode arrays. Hand\nassembly is very costly, extremely labor-intensive, and inadequate in implementing new strategies in\nOtolaryngology for improving speech recognition and music appreciation.\nAdvanced-manufacturing (microfabrication, laser-machining, etc.) has been deemed a superior replacement to\nthe hand-assembly of electrode arrays, and many innovations have been made in this area. However,\ncommercial suppliers have not adopted them. In large part, due to mismatches between the flat 2D bond pads\nof advanced-manufactured arrays and the 3D feedthrough pins of commercial stimulators. As such, they\nrequire additional adapters that not only reintroduce hand-assembly, but also add to the overall manufacturing\ncosts and clinical failures.\nMEMStim LLC proposes a plug-and-play advanced-manufacturing solution that relies heavily on 3D printing.\nBy printing conductive and nonconductive silicones, biocompatible pluggable arrays can be printed to any size,\nlength, shape or thickness, from several microns to tens of millimeters. Most importantly, the integrated\nconnectors plug readily onto stimulators by way of a novel micro-socket technology. The micro-sockets are\ncompatible and slide right onto the feedthrough pins. The printer resolution can output pluggable connectors\nthat are compatible with pin-to-pin pitches smaller than 100 \u00b5m (edge-to-edge), allowing for enhanced\nminiaturization.\nIn phase I work, high performing stimulating electrode sites and extension cables were demonstrated.\nAdditionally, the feasibility of producing high performing plug-and-play connectors was demonstrated. The goal\nof this Phase II project is to monolithically integrate all three into the first-ever pluggable cochlear electrode\narray. The Aims of the Phase II grant are: (1) Produce an integrated 3D printed plug-and-play cochlear array\nthat complies with the functional electrical requirements of cochlear implants; (2) Produce a 3D printed plug-\nand-play cochlear array that complies with the durability requirements of cochlear implants; and (3) Produce\n3D printed plug-and-play cochlear array that complies with the biocompatibility and surgical safety\nrequirements of cochlear implants. The end result will be the first-ever pluggable cochlear electrode array,\nwhich is functional and passes all the handling\/use\/safety tests that are necessary to seek approval from the\nFDA.Project Narrative\nWorldwide, approximately 466 million people suffer from disabling hearing loss, and\nCochlear implants are limited in their capabilities by the hand-assembly of wire-bundled\nelectrode arrays.

        "Abstract": "This project examines the feasibility of using a space-based quantum network for secure and accurate time transfer. The design and analysis of a space based quantum network that can support time transfer is expected to show that a relatively small modification of the current designs for quantum payloads could provide large benefits in the form of a highly accurate, non-spoofable\u00a0time transfer infrastructure. Conversely the relatively simple payloads required will highlight the possibility of combining PNT assets with quantum assets for a mutual augmentation.\u00a0 There is considerable effort in\u00a0the development of\u00a0quantum networks, which by design must always involve the distribution of entanglement. Recent results in time distribution using entangled photons highlight that there is\u00a0an opportunity to incorporate quantum time distribution\u00a0as an additional capability of quantum networks using the same\u00a0basic\u00a0resources\u00a0involved in distributing entanglement. This project will study a\u00a0space based\u00a0quantum network (a constellation) in its application for time distribution over long distances. The end result\u00a0of this work is to consider the performance of a quantum time distribution network in the broader context of quantum networks. With this information, this additional capability of quantum networks can be evaluated, equipment choices for future quantum payloads can be\u00a0selected and\u00a0trade-offs\u00a0of capabilities on the space components will become apparent. In addition,\u00a0with this analysis can inform the possibility of embedding\u00a0this capability on planned constellations that contain laser comms\u00a0hardware.\u00a0\u00a0"

        "Abstract": "Quantum networks are based on the distribution and utilization of entanglement among many nodes. Some of the more interesting applications of these networks depend on the ability to produce entanglement in a form that enables the implementation of teleportation and entanglement swapping protocols. In the absence of quantum memories, this requires the production of entanglement in tight time windows that enables the execution of joint measurements among photons from independent sources. This project aims to develop a high-quality pulsed source that avoids the use of large lasers typically used in teleportation and entanglement swapping demonstrations. The existence of such a source will be important for the establishment of long-distance quantum networks, particularly for eventual satellite applications. SQT will use its existing CubeSat format entanglement source as a starting point for developing this pulsed, low SWaP entanglement source."

First, we propose to apply GADRAS or GEANT4 to generate training data for different combinations of nuclear materials and\u00a0detectors. The training data contain spectral shapes of different detector responses. Second, we propose to use a Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) based technique for peak detection in spectral data. This cleaned data will be fed into machine learning algorithms. Third, we propose to use deep neural networks (DNN) techniques for nuclear material classification and composition estimation. Fourth, we also\u00a0propose to apply some non-machine learning based anomaly and material classification algorithms in our system. This is because ML system may not be able to handle unseen materials. A reliable system needs\u00a0to handle all situations. In particular, we propose to apply a linear spectral unmixing algorithm known as Non-negativity Constrained Least Square (NCLS) to estimate the abundance of nuclear materials. Our\u00a0team has applied NCLS to chemical agent detection, laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) data analysis, gold quality assessment, and rock sample analysis using X-ray spectra. We also propose to apply\u00a0spectral anomaly detection algorithms to detect materials that may not be seen before."

In this proposal, we describe capabilities and benefits of the current system and provide a plan to provide additional benefit to the Army via a Sequential Phase-II program.\u00a0 Benefits to the Army would be realized in the form of enhanced capability of the current system, in addition to core capabilities that would provide benefits in the form of future systems and laser technology in support of the Army\u2019s modernization priorities for long range precision fires and future vertical lift."

The proposed effort will demonstrate the feasibility of QCL signal amplification in rare-earth doped chalcogenide glass fiber in the MWIR.\u00a0 The doped chalcogenide fiber will serve as the keystone of an all-fiber laser amplifier system capable of delivering high power and good beam quality."

        "Abstract": "As the Army continues to move laser weapon systems (LWS) out of development and into the field there is a need for local atmospheric turbulence profiling to predict LWS performance and effectiveness in the use of these weapons. \u00a0Volumetric 3D turbulence profiler systems require a single-ended measurement device.\u00a0 Commercially available atmospheric turbulence profilers are either double-ended systems or require a down-range target board or beacon source.\u00a0 Thus, these systems are not suitable in a real-world operational scenario. Tau Technologies has developed a unique range resolved profiler system design that generates a guide star \u201cbeacon\u201d at various ranges from the instrument using a range-gated pulsed laser.\u00a0 Therefore, the instrument can be operated using a single-ended system design so that range resolved turbulence profiles can be directly measured over any line-of-sight without the need to place a source down-range.\u00a0 Using this technology, a 3D turbulence map can be determined for optimizing LWS emplacement and operation.\u00a0 Because of previous work in the modeling and system design for a single-ended profiler, we are exceptionally well positioned to transition our innovative approach to the unique needs of the Army for 3D volumetric atmospheric turbulence profiler systems.\u00a0 In addition, Tau Technologies experience in various artificial intelligence methods allows for turbulence forecasting.\u00a0 This is accomplished by using past measurements to train various adaptive machine learning algorithms so that accurate turbulence profiles can be predicted from the forecasted meteorological conditions."

This low-cost, low-technical risk solution will expand the mission capabilities and resolve a critical gap of the US Air Force A-10C Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft as identified by the Air Force Life Cycle Materiel Command (AFLCMC) in their report \u201cA-10C DoDAF View CV-3 Capability Phasing Roadmap\u201d, dated 02 Jan 2018. The A-10\u2019s current laser targeting pod is incapable of operating above a cloud layer, in fog, rain or dusty conditions. The conclusion of the AFLCMC study was that incorporation of a SAR will provide that needed capability. The A-10 SPO recognizes the benefits of SAR and believes the best manner to incorporate SAR onto the A-10C is via the AgilePod\u00ae. This integration will include minor structural modifications to the NSP-7, hardware and software integration into the AgilePod\u00ae, and analysis and lab testing to support future flight testing. This AgilePod\u00ae integration will also support non-Department of Defense customers such as Department of Homeland Security Air and Marine Operations and US Coast Guard as they reach beyond existing Electro Optical \/ Infrared technologies in their intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions."

FECS can be used to cool lasers, electronics or other devices in slow or fast-moving aircraft that are operating in high ambient temperatures. FECS utilizes a modular approach that allows it to be quickly and easily modified for various payloads. FECS is a vapor cycle system that utilizes state of the art components to provide the required cooling in the most energy efficient manner possible. It also incorporates an adaptive control system that allows it to adjust the mode of operation to maximize efficiency."

        "Abstract": "Many atomic processes occur on timescales that are as short as tens of femtoseconds. While pulsed lasers have the temporal resolution to investigate these processes, they cannot provide the requisite spatial resolution. Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) and Dynamic transmission electron microscopy (DTEM) are pulsed electron techniques that have been recently developed to examine the dynamics of these processes with adequate spatial resolution. Unfortunately, Coulomb interactions among the electrons broadens the temporal and spatial extent of the pulse. The Coulomb interactions mainly increase the beam energy spread (Boersch effect) from a fraction of an electron-Volt to hundreds or even thousands of electron-Volts. The Boersch effect has a two-fold impact on the electron optics: it spreads the arrival time window of the pulse from tens of femtoseconds to picoseconds and beyond; and it increases the objective lens chromatic aberration, which reduces the spatial resolution. Consequently, there remains a strong demand for improving the temporal resolution of the probing pulse without sacrificing total pulse charge and spatial resolution. In this SBIR project, EOI is developing a UEM column with atomic resolution, on the order of 3 \u212b, and capable of reducing the electron pulse length into the sub-nanosecond range for single shot applications with up to 10 million electrons\/pulse and into the deep femtosecond range for stroboscopic applications with thousands of electrons\/pulse. The key feature of this approach is the combination of a high energy electron gun, such as a superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) photocathode gun, and a novel electron column operating at up to 4 MeV. This approach has two major advantages compared to existing UEM designs: first, the acceleration to relativistic energies dramatically lowers the Coulomb effects due to electron-electron interactions, which allows the use of significantly more electrons\/pulse; and second, it pro- vides high temporal resolution that is accompanied by atomic scale resolution owing to a lens system with low aberrations. The column comprises three distinct components: the illumination arm, the objective lens, and the projection arm. In the initial Phase II, EOI produced a detailed mechano-optical design of the illumination arm and the objective lens and is currently assembling the prototype. EOI plans to complete the prototype by the end of the initial phase II and ready it for integration with a high energy RF gun. In the sequential Phase IIA, EOI aims to complete the UEM column by designing, building and integrating the projection optics. EOI plans to assemble and test the UEM column, integrate it with the electron gun at a DOE facility and verify experimentally the performance of the instrument in diffraction and imaging modes.EOI\u2019s novel UEM column provides a path to a product targeted for emerging ultrafast applications, thus making it suitable for enhancing the study of the structure, composition, and bonding states of new materials at ultrafast time scales to advance material science research in the field of nanotechnology and in particular in biomedical research."

The proposed system will leverage Vescent\u2019s expertise in developing micro-optic-based diode laser systems with low size, weight, and power (SWaP) for deployed applications in inertial sensing and cold-atom clocks. Physical Sciences Inc.\u2019s (a subcontractor) team are experts in atom interferometry and cold-atom-based sensors, having previously demonstrated miniature vapor cells and cold-atom sources developed to support portable inertial measurement systems, and will help Vescent develop a low SWaP, environmentally robust laser system that meets the performance needs of the solicitation and yet provides a scalable, configurable architecture to meet the future needs of atom-based sensors. A program goal is to deliver standalone \u201cplug-and-play\u201d laser modules with integrated electronics, optics, and diode lasers that occupy less than 5% volume and consume less than 20% electrical power of available commercial frequency-stabilized laser systems. These laser modules in turn form the basis of a rack-mounted, multi-laser system that will be delivered at the successful completion of a Phase 2 program and will meet the laser performance requirements of the Navy atom interferometer while operating on a mobile platform."

OFCs are a core tool of quantum timing, enabling a range of new technologies critical to the U.S. Air Force, including but not limited to optical atomic clocks, free-space time transfer in GPS denied environments, and low phase-noise microwave sources for time dissemination and sensitive radar detection.\u00a0 However, to construct an OFC with the absolute phase stability required for these applications, the OFC must be stabilized to an ultra-narrow linewidth reference laser.\u00a0 MIT-LL has demonstrated a compact, ultra-narrow linewidth, low drift fiber laser based on stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) that was used to successfully interrogate a 88Sr+ optical clock.\u00a0 The technique is easily adaptable to any visible and near-infrared (NIR) wavelength and has significant potential to replace lasers locked to ULE cavities as a low SWaP-C reference laser for fieldable OFCs and optical clocks. Vescent, in partnership with MIT-LL, proposes to develop and commercialize a narrow linewidth SBS laser at 1556 nm and use the laser to fully stabilize a low SWaP-C, portable OFC for use in low-noise X-band microwave generation, high-fidelity time transfer, and ultra-stable optical atomic clocks. \u00a0"

        "Abstract": "Additive manufacturing AM), esp. laser AM, becomes a powerful tool to replace conventional methods due to its cost effectiveness and capability of making complex structure and composition. However, direct fabrication of optics parts is still a challenging field, mainly due to limited understanding of process control, powder fabrication, and laser melting mechanism to eliminate defects and bubbles. Statement of how this problem or situation is being addressed. Based on our patented laser AM technology and the world\u2019s first demonstration of fs fiber laser AM system 2016 R&amp;D Award), PolarOnyx proposes, for the first time, a pulsed UV fiber laser based AM process to overcome these difficulties and meet the requirement of making capillary optics just in one process. The UV beam is shaped to have same size and shape of the capillary optics at a given layer position so the whole layer of nano-particle is melt simultaneously to eliminate the thermal induced stress in the final product. The SM function gives trimming and defect correction for the processed glass parts. This multi- functional capability SM and AM) is not achievable for CW laser AM and will significantly reduce the building time and cost. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits. In addition to the 3D AM applications, material processing is another major commercial application for this project. This includes 1) Photonic device fabrications, such as waveguide, coupler, WDM, modulator, and switching; 2) all types of metal processing such as welding, cutting, annealing, and drilling; 3) semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing such as lithography, inspection, control, defect analysis and repair, and via drilling; 4) marking of all materials including plastic, metals, and silicon; 5) other materials processing such as rapid prototyping, desk top manufacturing, micromachining, photofinishing, embossed holograms, and grating manufacturing."

        "Abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM), esp. laser AM, becomes a powerful tool to replace conventional methods such as casting and hot spray, due to its cost effectiveness and capability of making complex structure and composition. However, direct melting of high temperature ceramic materials and fabrication of large multi-material radial collimators is still a challenging field, mainly due to limited understanding of composition control, laser melting control, and melted structure formation and phase transition. Based on our patented laser AM technology and the world\u2019s first product of fs fiber laser AM, PolarOnyx proposes, for the first time, a super large AM\/SM system to overcome these difficulties and meet the requirement of making large radial collimators. Significant breakthroughs were made: Achieved high density (&gt;99%) and excellent mechanical properties for the metal\/ceramic structures, and world\u2019s first successful demonstration on neutron scattering using 3D printed parts. PolarOnyx will prototype the large AM\/SM system to make nuclear quality and complex radial collimators. Composition optimization helps neutron scattering measurement. In addition to the 3D AM applications (potential $44B market in 2025), material processing is another major commercial application for this project. This includes (1) Photonic device fabrications, such as waveguide, coupler, WDM, modulator, and switching; (2) all types of metal processing such as welding, cutting, annealing, and drilling; (3) semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing such as lithography, inspection, control, defect analysis and repair, and via drilling; (4) other materials processing such as rapid prototyping, desk top manufacturing, micromachining, photofinishing, embossed holograms, and grating manufacturing."

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in computing systems fundamentally changed and shaped almost every aspect of today\u2019s society; from healthcare to finances and scientific discoveries, our everyday lives will depend more and more on computing and communication infrastructures and their capability to process and deliver critical information in real time. However, as high-performance-computing systems and datacenters already consume megawatts of power, enabling sustainable scaling of future computing systems must consider energy-efficient, parallel, and accelerated heterogeneous processing that can be commercially deployed. The proposed project pursues energy-efficient, high-performance, and universal accelerator interfaces to sustain the ever-increasing demand for scalable and ubiquitous computing processing power. Application domains like high performance computing and machine learning now process data sets of terabytes in size, requiring increasing numbers of processing and memory resources, at the expenses of very high-power consumption due to bottlenecks in the electrical interconnection between processing units. This project aims at significantly reducing the communication energy and latency by developing novel technologies in silicon photonic reconfigurable interconnects to optimally adapt the communication bandwidth and interconnection topology as data flow patterns change for specific application workloads. The research team achieved the following key milestones: (a) fabrication, packaging and testing of an 8-port 16 wavelength reconfigurable all-to-all silicon photonic fabric enabling bandwidth and topology reconfiguration among interconnected nodes; (b) fabrication and testing of low-loss and low-crosstalk integrated optical multiplexers and grating structures for multi-wavelength comb sources; (c) fabrication, packaging and system integration of silicon photonic transceivers bonded with high-speed electronic drivers; (d) assembling a prototype accelerator board for preliminary system testing with all the components fabricated above.For Phase II project, the research team will build upon the milestones achieved in Phase I project to deliver the following key results: (a) 32-wavelength laser with 100GHz spacing; (b) packaged 16-port 32 wavelength reconfigurable all-to-all silicon photonic fabric with electrical control plane for driving the topology and bandwidth reconfiguration between the interconnected nodes; (c) system integration and assembly of accelerator linecards using multi-wavelength electro-optic transceivers and heterogeneous processors; (d) final system demonstration of up to sixteen accelerator linecards interconnected through the fabricated 16-port reconfigurable photonic fabric. The successful completion of this project will lead to significant improvements in energy and performance of large-scale data centers and high-performance computing systems, paving the way for the wide-spread of emerging artificial intelligence applications which are heavily relying on application-specific accelerator units."

        "Abstract": "Applied Spectra will fabricate a prototype field portable instrument for rapid isotopic analysis based on the demonstrated Phase I technology using an Atmospheric Pressure Glow Discharge (APGD) excitation\/ionization source with Laser Ablation (LA) sampling and Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES). The new instrument is a paradigm shift for rapid field analysis of elements\/isotopes without requiring sample preparation or consumables. The APGD was tested as an independent atomization-ionization source as well as a secondary excitation source to extend laser-induced plasma optical emission persistence. The Phase I effort showed that the APGD configured as an atomization\/excitation source was the configuration of choice to provide U isotope ratios in the field with laboratory sensitivity and precision, with components that will fit in a portable (battery operated) Pelican-case footprint. Optical isotopic analysis will be measured from atomic and ionic line and molecular band emission spectra. Data analytics using chemometrics will be implemented to achieve isotopic ratio precision at sub-percent levels. The prototype portable instrument will be bench-marked against laboratory mass spectrometry measurements of U235\/238 ratios using standards provided by Y12 and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory."

The LMOG is used to magnetically locate undersea cables. The LMOG design will consist of four laser-pumped omnidirectional scalar sensors placed along the platform longitudinal axis in a housing that is a roll-on, roll-off module for the LDUUV. Polatomic laser magnetometer technology was recently demonstrated in the Laser Scalar Gradiometer at AUV FEST with outstanding results achieved very high scores in the Mk18 Mod 2 Kingfish UUV. The individual gradiometers will have a sensitivity better than 2pT\/root-Hz. The LMOG design will address miniaturization and packaging for integration onto the LDUUV in a location for optimum performance. A trade study will identify the optimum location which may be inboard or external to the LDUAV. The feasibility of designing and fabricating LMOG, signal processing for locating the cable and cable breaks and integration onto the LDUUV will be established in Phase I and demonstrated in Phase II. The Phase II technical plan will be developed for design and fabrication of a prototype system which will be integrated onto an LDUUV and demonstrated in Phase II."

        "Abstract": "OEwaves Inc. offers to develop a compact diode laser system producing all the required wavelengths for operation of an Yb Ion Clocks. It will include 370 nm, 935 nm, 436 nm and 760 nm lasers. The system will feature the properties required for long duration space applications. The system will be based on a semiconductor laser locked to monolithic microcavities using self-injection locking technique. This technique results in a complete suppression of mode hops in the laser during its operational lifetime. The microcavity will not only stabilize the frequency of the laser, but will also be used to measure and stabilize the power of the laser. The microcavity provides a modulatable laser that features exceptionally low residual amplitude modulation, allowing a robust lock to the clock transition of interest.nbsp; The proof of principle validation of the technique was supported by earlier OEwaves efforts. In Phase II of this Project we propose to demonstrate experimentally and deliver to the customer two most critical components of the set, comprising a 370 nm laser system and an ultastable cavity. The other lasers will be demonstrated at OEwaves and the measurement data will be delivered to the customer. The complete set of narrow-line ultra-stable modulatable diode lasers that can be instrumental in integration of a miniature Yb space ion clock will be packaged in Phase III of the project.nbsp;At the end of Phase II, we expect a prototype of 370nm laser to achieve better than 10-10\/g acceleration sensitivity, required frequency stability (varies depending on the laser use). The reference cavity will have the same stability in a wide wavelength (frequency) range determined by the optical transparency of its host material, which typically is broader than 300 nm ndash; 2,000 nm. The quality factor of the device will exceed 108, which will add to simplification in locking optical sources to the modes of the resonator.nbsp;"

        "Abstract": "LADAR (laser detection and ranging) is an enabling technology for remote sensing, enabling 3D target recognition, detection through obscurants, and monitoring and mapping a scene. A new generation of avalanche photodetectors is needed to align with recent advances in 2 \u03bcm fiber laser technology. At this wavelength, lasers are eye safe, atmospheric transmission is good, and long-distance objects can be detected and tracked. Current LADAR systems use a high performance but expensive detector technology with mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT, HgCdTe1) that has low yield and high non-uniformity.\u00a0 SK Infrared LLC (SKIR) and The Ohio State University (OSU) are teaming together to develop a LADAR sensing solution using InAs APDs. During the Phase I effort, the industry and academic team built on its existing collaboration with AFRL Sensors Directorate, AFRL\/RY (Drs. Reyner\/Raab\/ Woods) to identify a customer in the Air Force Life Cycle Management program executive office (PEO). At the end of the proposed Phase II, we will deliver a small format, high sensitivity array for laboratory testing for AF applications. These linear mode detectors have the ability to not only detect just a few photons in an active mode, but also to perform grayscale imaging in passive mode. The combination of these two capabilities enables higher degrees of detection, recognition, and identification. Unlike traditional PN junction detectors that do not have a selectable internal gain, APDs have multiplication gain resulting from impact ionization of carriers. In an APD, the primary carriers give rise to secondary electron-hole pairs that in turn can multiply. This leads to an avalanche effect and increases the current. There are several key engineering questions that need to be addressed in order to transition this advancement in science to a real technology that can be deployed by the AF. Some of the research questions that need to be addressed are: 1. What are the fundamental limits of the photon sensitivity in terms of noise equivalent photons? 2. Can the InAs APDs operate at 150-200 K? What are the bulk dark current mechanisms that contribute to noise in these diodes? An increase in the Top will lead to huge advantage in terms of reduction of size, weight, and power (SWaP) of a LADAR system 3. How can we suppress the surface leakage current when the pixel size is shrunk from 260 \u03bcm in diameter to &lt; 100 \u03bcm? Can we develop a dry-etching process to delineate the pixels since the wet etching is not manufacturable and scalable? 4. Can we develop a process to transition from a front-side illuminated single element detector in a university laboratory environment to a back-side illuminated array geometry that lends itself to integration with the LADAR system? The defense LADAR market shows significant potential for Air Force ISR systems. The proposed technology will match a new generation of 2 \u03bcm lasers for LADAR illumination for ISR."

        "Abstract": "This proposal addresses subtopic 9.6.01, Low-cost Oceanic and Atmospheric Sensors and Observing Systems. It is proposed that two instruments for measuring atmospheric aerosols be commercialized to operate automatically and routinely. Both instruments have been used in research settings for many years and share several aspects of technology. They could both be commercialized with significant advantages in cost and performance over currently available instruments. The first is the CLidar which measures aerosol profiles and also operates as a star-photometer to measure aerosol optical depth (AOD). Visibility and cloud ceiling are directly calculated from the data collected. The CLidar is currently limited to twilight and nighttime conditions but use of an infrared camera and laser may allow daytime operation.  The second instrument is an imaging polar nephelometer (IPN) that has been patented by the principle investigator (PI). The IPN gives a detailed in-situ measurement, day and night, of scattered light from aerosols. The IPN measures the angular dependence of the scattered light. There are many commercial integrating nephelometers available but much information is lost when only the total scattered light is measured. The IPN has an excellent potential for measuring detailed aerosol properties relating to the aerosol size distribution, composition and shape."

(Intellisense) proposes to develop a new Laser Irradiance Sensor and Alert (LISA) system based on a multi-aperture detector array that covers a 2-pi steradian (360 by 90 degree) field of view (FOV) and distinguishes laser sources from non-laser sources by the correlations in intensity among the detectors. By using dual-band, high-speed photodiode detectors, LISA provides high sensitivity, thereby allowing it to detect both continuous wave and pulsed laser sources at power levels of only 500 microwatt per sq. cm. This, combined with its large dynamic range across both the visible and shortwave infrared wavebands (450-1600 nm), enables it to operate in day and night lighting conditions while minimizing the number of sensors required, thereby minimizing the overall size, weight, and power requirements of the system and thus ensuring compatibility with conformal wearable battery sources while providing operating times &gt;72 hr. As its correlation algorithm, which incorporates checks to minimize false positives, need only correlate a small number of detectors, LISA is able to notify the user of the presence and location of a laser source in"

        "Abstract": "To address the Navy need for non-destructive technology for inclusion content detection in high-grade steel components, Intellisense Systems, Inc. proposes to develop a new Nondestructive Inclusion Detector (INTER) system, based on the use of laser ultrasonic methods augmented by an artificial neural network (ANN). Specifically, the innovation in using the picosecond laser ultrasonic methods for ultrasound generation enables high frequency acoustic signal generation that is needed to detect micron-size inclusions. Also, using an ANN for acoustic pattern recognition allows fast and accurate identification and measurement of inclusion content such as size distribution, location, and material. As a result, the INTER system offers accurate, non-destructive inspection of size distribution and position of inclusion content inside steel, including in complex geometries like gear teeth. In Phase I, Intellisense will demonstrate the feasibility of the INTER by designing and developing a breadboard prototype and determining the inclusion content such as size distribution, location, and material of inclusion. In Phase II, Intellisense plans to develop and demonstrate a non-destructive inspection capability for inclusions with blind steel samples that are in-process and post-produced with inclusion sizes down to 0.001 in. The Phase II prototype will meet the requirement for rapid, near instantaneous analysis of steel in manufacturing sites, production sites, and repair facilities."

        "Abstract": "To address the Navy\u2019s need for a modernized laser event recorder, Intellisense Systems, Inc. proposes to develop a new Aviation LAser StriKe Alert (ALASKA) system based on a novel design fusing multiple sensors. Specifically, the innovation in utilizing a circular diffraction mask coupled with imaging sensors allows the system to simultaneously act as a spectrometer, detect angle of incidence, and record video of the event. When paired with a sensor fusion algorithm for false positive mitigation, this simple solution enables the instrument to detect laser strikes from the cockpit, while minimizing its size and power requirements. The combination of both silicon and indium gallium arsenide imaging sensors provides full wavelength coverage from the deep ultraviolet to the near-infrared. Position sensors and fast photodiodes allow for laser strike localization and determination of the pulse length, repetition frequency, and duration of a laser strike. Fisheye objectives and tilted optical mounts are used to maximize the field of view. A night vision compatible display will warn the aircrew of a laser attack. Along with video from the scene, laser strike parameters are saved to a SD card. The sensor data fusion algorithm helps minimize both the false positives and the number of required sensors. ALASKA is a stand-alone, battery operated device. In Phase I, Intellisense will design and develop a concept for the device. Intellisense will demonstrate the feasibility of ALASKA by testing the device\u2019s response to laser irradiation. The Phase I final report will include detailed prototype plans to be developed under Phase II. In Phase II, Intellisense plans to continue development of the concept proposed in Phase I and to design and demonstrate a prototype device to address all parameters. We will include a design for either aircraft or aircrew mounting, and perform preliminary testing for ruggedness."

Specifically, the innovative modification and improvement of stellar interferometry by using scanning holographic planar afocal telescopes, a fiber-linked optical waveguide stellar interferometer with dynamically controlled telescope phasing via local interferometer laser metrology, with surface-mounted micro-optics delay line, and a focal plane fringe sensor allows HoloSTAR to be extremely accurate and have low SWaP. As a result, it will be deployable on the Trident II (D5) weapon system and reconfigurable for astronomical imaging and data collection required by the Navy. In Phase I, Intellisense will develop the design of the HoloSTAR system that implements the NASA JPL interferometer fringes technique to measure stars extremely accurately, meet the Navy\u2019s SWaP and accuracy requirements, and demonstrate its feasibility by computer simulation and experimental testing via a laboratory setup. Potential risks will be identified and a mitigation plan will be developed. In Phase II, Intellisense will develop and deliver a prototype HoloSTAR system for Navy hardware-in-the-loop testing in emulated missile and spacecraft environments and will implement changes via the Navy\u2019s feedback."

By innovatively implementing high dynamic range SLMs for pixelwise optical modulation and laser-induced IR emission from the VACNT, HIRACE enables large resolution (&gt; 4k x 2k) projection of dynamic scene (8-16-bit) at high frame rates (~1000 Hz). The modular design enables the projection of dynamic imagery over a broad wavelength range, with each module covering a specific spectral regime (i.e., SWIR, MWIR or LWIR). It also makes the system reconfigurable (projecting multispectral scenes simultaneously, in sequence, or selectively) and capable of selecting a specific spectral band inside the SWIR, MWIR or LWIR regimes in each module. In Phase I, Intellisense plans to establish the technical feasibility of HIRACE by developing initial designs, analyzing the feasibility, developing components and modules tuned specifically toward dual color IR clutter generation, and integrating and evaluating a HIRACE proof-of-concept prototype. In Phase II, Intellisense will focus on the development of a detailed system design and will build a HIRACE prototype that functions as a dual-color IR clutter generator with needed software to test and develop IR models and scenes for HITL test and evaluation of MWS."

Specifically, the innovative use of a novel measurement scheme with mostly mature commercial components will enable this measurement system to be used to measure turbulence effect-free, range-resolved, total atmospheric absorption spectral data. As a result, this new device will offer real-time thermal blooming prediction capabilities in a field-portable device for use with high energy laser weapon systems. In Phase I, Intellisense will conduct a full system architecture development focusing on the design of a lidar-based absorption measurement system and will analyze the analytical model of thermal blooming prediction. Based on this design and simulation analysis, Intellisense will develop a preliminary design that will establish high confidence in the TOPAAS system\u2019s ability to meet the Army requirements in the field test environment, and the theoretical process for determining thermal blooming based on measurements from the system. In Phase II, Intellisense will fabricate, test, and evaluate a breadboard TOPAAS system using the Phase I design. After conducting initial testing and system performance evaluation, the system design will be modified as necessary to produce a final full-scale prototype. The final TOPAAS system prototype will be demonstrated in a field test or controlled environmental chamber to validate its thermal blooming prediction accuracy."

        "Abstract": "Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) offers to tap almost unlimited sources of inexpensive energy. This new energy source would free the U.S. from the dependence on hydrocarbon fuels, the use of which produces green-house gases (GHG). The proposed laser driver would greatly advance the ICF maturity and its transition to commercial IFE for generation of electricity by circumventing the engineering challenges to the conventional hot spot ignition (HSI). Availability of low-cost and non-polluting electric power would revolutionize transportation and manufacturing sectors, thus boosting the overall economy. Reduced dependence on hydrocarbon fuels would also reduce to size overstated importance of hydrocarbon-producing countries, thus, improving geopolitical balance. The proposed technology also offers to advance laser acceleration of nuclear particles, thus replacing the traditional mammoth-size and costly accelerator research facilities with room-size devices. Compactness and relative simplicity of laser accelerators promises to greatly reduce the cost and timelines of high-energy research, and advance new scientific discoveries. As particle research could become affordable for universities or even commercial laboratories, the U.S. would be able to maintain leadership. In Phase I, Aqwest investigated a compact liquid-cooled laser gain module as a building block for a HPE \/ HRR laser for the generation and heating of HEDP. The innovative gain module leverages and further extends Aqwest&apos;s edge- pumped disk laser (EPDL) technology, which enables efficient amplification of high-energy pulses with high-peak power at high repletion rate, high efficiency, and with near-diffraction-limited beam quality (BQ). In particular, we developed a preliminary design for the compact EPDL amplifier module offering a common architecture customizable for specialty applications. In Phase II, we will develop and demonstrate full-scale HPE \/ HRR laser gain module(s) based on the Phase I \u201ccommon architecture\u201d designs, construct advanced heat sink for removal of waste heat, and generate a design for multi-module amplifier. This work will validate the compact EPDL-based liquid-cooled gain module as a building block for a HPE \/ HRR laser for the generation and heating of HEDP. The proposed project would greatly advance research in planetary astrophysics, geophysics, materials science, medicine, ICF, and defense. In commercial applications, EPDL offers to supplant the German-made thin disk laser, which has been the dominant technology for laser material processing for the last 15 years."

        "Abstract": "The current state-of-the-artnbsp; 2-micro;m lidar transmitters for global wind and the CO2 measurement use Ho3+ laser ions respectively doped into LuLiF or YLF host. Ho3+ is typically pumped to a laser transition by a 1.9 micro;m Tm-based laser which, in-turn, is pumped by semiconductor diodes. This 2-step process compromises electro-optical efficiency and generates significant waste heat while adding volume and weight to the transmitter payload.Aqwest proposes to develop a novel, efficient, compact, and rugged lidar transmitter based on Tm doped into an innovative ceramic host material. This transformational Tm:ceramic material offers efficient lasing in the vicinity of 2050 nm while being directly pumped by 796-nm diodes, thus resulting in a very simple architecture, more compact packaging, lighter weight, and more efficient operation when compared to the traditional quot;Tm-pumped Hoquot; laser transmitters for global wind and the CO2 measurement. The Tm:ceramic transmitter offers high-pulse energy and high-repetition rate in the vicinity of 2050 nm. Aqwest recently demonstrated efficient lasing in ceramic Tm:ceramic with a record continuous wavelength tuning over 230 nm (1890-2120 nm). We are currently developing a kW-class average power 2 micro;m laser based on the same Tm:ceramic Department of Energy."

        "Abstract": "Thermal management onboard military aircraft is a growing area of need. Advanced sensors and weapon systems often have large intermittent thermal loads which must be managed. In particular, Directed Energy Weapons (DEWs) tend to be inherently inefficient with correspondingly high thermal loads that need to be managed. This Army topic calls for in-flight production of cryogen for thermal management of DEWs. The target application is to cool a 50 kW thermal load from a laser weapon using liquid cryogen. For airborne application the size, weight, and power of the cryogen production equipment are all a significant consideration. We propose to develop a lightweight turbo-Brayton cryocooler system for in flight liquid cryogen production. Our system features novel components that meet the topic requirements for cryogen production while minimizing the overall size, weight, and power of the system. Creare has significant experience developing cryocoolers for aircraft, spacecraft, military, and medical applications including cryogen generation onboard aircraft. In Phase I, we will perform our system level design using detailed analysis and evaluate lightweight cryogen storage options. In Phase II, we will prototype and demonstrate a full-scale system in a laboratory setting."

        "Abstract": "Composite airframe designs benefit significantly from incorporation of adhesive bond joints rather than metal fasteners. Adhesive bonds can be exceptionally strong and lightweight, but require careful process control to form. In order to rely on such joints, both the Air Force and commercial manufacturers require a non-destructive test method to verify the quality of as-built joints. The only known test is shock-loaded bond inspection, in which a brief, high amplitude stress wave is coupled into the joint to interrogate its strength. The current standard for performing this inspection requires a massive pulsed laser to produce the mechanical shock. This system works well in the laboratory, but the expensive 10,000 pound laser and unwieldy articulated arm make the system completely impractical in a production environment. We have developed a novel transduction mechanism to replace this laser. Our mechanism is orders of magnitude smaller and more efficient, as well as dramatically simpler and more reliable, but produces precisely the same stress wave in the tested part. A shock-loaded bond inspection system incorporating our novel transducer will enable truly practical measurements on the aircraft production floor using a simple, handheld transducer."

        "Abstract": "MZA proposes development of a Directed Energy Environmental Decision System (DEEDS) providing a decision aid combining the use of a scaling law modeling tool, Scaling for HEL and Relay Engagements (SHaRE), that has gone through the formal verification and validation (V&amp;V) process with realistic meteorological conditions. DEEDS makes use of atmospheric profile descriptions generated by the Laser Environmental Effects Definition and Reference (LEEDR) that are based on real-time or forecasted meteorological conditions along with robust modeling of volumetric atmospheric turbulence which is anchored by measurements. The DEEDS interface will provide analysts and operators reliable and realistic estimates of electro-optical (EO) weapon system performance. DEEDS software will incorporate turbulence data into advanced machine-learning algorithms for continual training of turbulence models. Daily and seasonal models will be output in a form easily used by DEEDS (via SHaRE) along with numerical weather forecast data. DEEDS will include EO missions whose operation depends heavily on atmospheric conditions, such as space object surveillance and identification, space situational awareness, as well probabilistic satellite predictive avoidance and collateral effects and risk assessment. DEEDS testing will support collaborative evaluation of laser propagation and active sensors. We will conduct deployment of the DEEDS to support experimental campaigns."

        "Abstract": "Wave-optics simulations are critical tools for analysis of laser directed energy systems. The primary method for conducting these simulations is to evaluate the Fresnel diffraction integral using the angular spectrum method based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). While FFTs are considered computationally efficient, their use in the Fresnel integral results in difficult grid constraints including zero-padding. In simulating airborne laser systems, Monte Carlo methods are needed to represent random processes like platform jitter and optical turbulence. This combines with the need for time-series to represent beam control systems to create many evaluations. The Fresnel diffraction integral must be evaluated at least once for each time step or random draw. Therefore, we seek the fastest possible numerical calculation of Fresnel diffraction integral. MZA proposes to circumvent the FFT use with a semi-analytic evaluation. This leaves fewer numerical computations and provides numerous benefits over the angular-spectrum method. With this method, zero-padding is unnecessary, and the output grid points are arbitrary."

        "Abstract": "Present, traditional devices that measure water turbidity, bathymetry, or flow velocity either must be in contact with the water being measured and\/or come at a high cost and are difficult to use. The proposed work aims to develop and deploy a single low-cost laser remote sensor for measurements of turbidity, bathymetry and flow velocity. The sensing platform will be low enough in size\/weight\/power\/cost to be readily deployed as an in-situ sensor at remote field sites as well as be mounted to small drones for performing surveys or large bodies of water. Phase I will build and characterize a laser remote sensor. The tasks will consist of building the instrument, performing calibration and characterization tests in the lab, and at a test site. Because the instrument is inherently simple, the majority of the Phase I effort can concentrate on data collection and characterization, with room for sensor design iterations if needed. In addition, part of the Phase I will involve detailing a plan for work in Phase II that would integrate the sensors into a scalable sensor network and software infrastructure for remote viewing of measurement data in real time. The initial inspiration for the measurement approach was borne out of a water quality monitoring need for detection and sizing of suspended solids concentrations. While commercial nephelometers exist for this purpose, there are limitations in their method of measurement. To address these limitations, the company has worked on developing an alternative measurement method that can also measure quantities such as depth-resolved flow speed, water height, and water turbidity. The funding will enable the maturation of the technology to the point of being able to be used as a commercial product by any who need one or more of the data products just described."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nHarnessing the therapeutic promise of immunotherapy against cancer has evolved from strategies focused on\nthe antigen-recognition mechanisms of adaptive immunity (e.g. checkpoint inhibition and CAR-T cells) to\nstrategies leveraging direct cytotoxicity mechanisms of innate immunity. The clinical impact of these exciting\nnew immunotherapy strategies can be realized only with customized technologies and products for Natural\nKiller (NK) cells, central to direct cytotoxicity mechanisms of innate immunity - e.g. achieving reliable, low-risk\nand low-cost \u200bex vivo expansion of patient-derived NK cells, which remains a strong unmet need and an\nunderserved niche in immunotherapy. Our proposal aims to achieve a serum-free media supplement for NK\ncells through a novel combination of plant-derived ingredients and traditional media supplements, guided in\nprototyping with a fractional-factorial statistical toolkit for recipe optimization. To achieve this goal, our Phase-I\nproposal outlines two specific aims - one to optimize the prototype serum-free media recipe with\ncell-proliferation and viability performance being key end-points, and two to further fine-tune the prototype\nserum-free media recipe with cytotoxicity and biomarker end-points pertaining to both apoptosis and necrosis\nmechanisms of direct cytotoxicity by NK cells, both specific aims guided with a statistical approach for efficient\noptimization. For the pursuit of both these specific aims, the proposed NK cell line is the p53 mutation based\nKHYG1 NK cell line, followed by a confirmation of the key experimental end-points with 3 distinct batches of\nprimary human NK cells. At the end of Phase-I, we envision a lead formulation for a novel and effective\nserum-free media supplement that is specific to NK cell growth and maintenance of NK cell phenotype and\nfunctions (e.g. cytotoxicity mechanisms). The Enable Life Sciences LLC team is well positioned to pursue the\nproject goal starting with the proposed Phase-I specific aims. In addition to being led by the proposed Principal\nInvestigator (PI), Dr. Rachit Ohri (CEO and Founder of Enable Life Sciences) who has the relevant expertise,\nthe proposed effort will be well supported by other team members such as Donna Sonntag (MS from the\nUniversity of Massachusetts, Lowell) and other scientists and support staff. The Enable Life Sciences labs in\nWorcester MA already houses the requisite equipment and instrumentation, namely flow cytometers, Luminex,\nmicroscopes, BL2 (biosafety level 2) biological safety cabinets etc. Moreover, Enable Life Sciences is well\nentrenched in an ecosystem in an around Worcester MA, which is deeply facilitative for the proposed\nobjectives of this Phase-I proposal. These include a supportive Randamp;D and business environment, for example\naccess to advanced instrumentation such as multi-laser flow cytometry, confocal fluorescence microscopy etc.\nat University Core Research Facilities (CRFs) at numerous campus sites in the North-East. In a nutshell, our\nproposal includes carefully crystallized, relevant and achievable objectives and methodologies, additionally we\nare well-positioned as an organization to achieve the envisioned serum-free media supplement for NK cells.Project Narrative\nThe promise of immunotherapy relies heavily on the ability to expand immune cells outside of\nthe human body, and then re-injecting them into the patient. In order to harness the innate\nkilling ability of a key immune cell in our bodies, i.e. the \u201cNatural Killer\u201d (NK) cell, this barrier of\nreliable \u201c\u200bex-vivo\u200b\u201d expansion must be overcome. Our SBIR Phase-I proposal seeks to address\nthis need by developing a novel serum alternative for rapid ex-vivo expansion of Natural Killer\ncells while promoting their immunotherapeutic potential. In contrast to conventional\nserum-based expansion methods, this novel serum alternative will provide consistent,\nrepeatable results while at the same time lowering risk and cost, and will therefore support the\nadvancement of Natural Killer cell-based immunotherapy for treating cancer and other diseases."

        "Abstract": "Because of the maneuvering capabilities of adversaries\u2019 new hypersonic weapons, defensive missiles must fly in very demanding flight regimes, and intercept maneuvers place stringent requirements on interceptor seeker systems. Successfully completing the hit-to-kill end game requires the seeker can either compensate for or perform despite the thermal and optical effects that cause the seeker to misreport the target state vector. To ensure the seeker can overcome these effects, robust and detailed modeling is required that can predict seeker performance in all expected flight conditions. Robust modeling requires, in turn, the ability to validate and anchor the model output by appropriate and relevant ground testing that emulates flight conditions as closely as possible. Ground testing can not only validate the models but can improve their predictions if better input data are available. In this Phase II STTR effort, Polaris Sensor Technologies is proposing to develop, test and demonstrate a new measurement technique that provides a data product that improves the modeling capability through ground test validation. This technique enables more credible and flexible modeling for flight conditions that cannot be tested on the ground. This technique leverages the polarization beam combining and splitting used in the Phase I SBIR (Topic AF071-340, Contract FA9101-07-M-009). In this effort, Polaris designed a scene projector polarization controller (SPPC) that produced an arbitrarily defined linear polarization state for test chamber sources. Also during Phase I, Polaris designed an imaging system for characterizing test facility sources. In a subsequent Phase II, Polaris developed the proposed optical system for the 7 V and 10 V chambers. The underlying concept of the SPPC forms the core of the technology proposed here, which will also be used to produce controlled states for measurements in test chambers. The current effort adds the capability of two wavefront sensors (WFSs) and synchronized pulsed lasers to achieve the additional measurements. In the proposed system, two distinct instantiations of the flow in the wind tunnel can be imaged with a specified time delay, td\u00ad . The laser pulse is short enough to effectively freeze the flow, and the WFS image gives a snapshot optical phase screen. The real strength of the technique arises when td\u00ad is set such that the flow moves along the window only a small fraction of the window length. By performing a correlation on the two images, the turbulence correlation length LC and density \u03c1\u2019 can be determined directly. By doing this repeatedly, the distribution of LC and \u03c1\u2019 can be built up, which replaces the flow field characterization in the aero-optic model with measured data that were previously derived from the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the wind tunnel. This technique is the Multiple Image Spatial Phase Polarization Collection (SPPC) Turbulence Imager (MISTI) and details follow. Approved for Public Release | 20-MDA-10601 (19 Oct 20)"

Recent experiments conducted by the DoD have shown the potential of new High Energy Laser (HEL) and High Power Microwave (HPM) weapons for threat mitigation, but the long response time during the detection, tracking, and identification stage limits the effectiveness of these defeat systems, especially against high velocity threats. Specific bottlenecks that slow response time include the chain of command and number of human interactions, manual prioritization and cueing of multiple threats, and the ability to transform target position into easily actionable parameters for use by a defeat system. CRG and its partner propose to demonstrate a unique C-UAS software suite that provides automatic target classification, video tracking, and threat prioritization to automate the C-UAS detect-identify-defeat process. CRG and its partner will perform multiple experiments to identify operator needs and perform multiple software development iterations to improve the software and speed up the kill chain. This approach is flexible and can be adapted to both C-UAS and CMD applications."

        "Abstract": "The Army has identified six (6) modernization priorities to increase readiness for future multi-domain operations (MDO). Improved gun-launched munitions are applicable to several of these priorities, including increased soldier lethality, long range precision fires, and air and missile defense. Off-body laser discharge has demonstrated promising results in literature for reducing drag over aerodynamic bodies at supersonic speeds. However, these systems have not been demonstrated in operational environments. Cornerstone Research Group, Inc. (CRG) proposes to develop, demonstrate, and deliver a laser-enhanced drag reduction system to improve performance of gun-launched munitions. CRG will leverage their extensive knowledge and experience in aerodynamics, experimental wind tunnel testing, modeling and simulation, and power management and energy storage systems. During this Phase I effort, CRG will evaluate the feasibility of laser enhanced aerodynamic drag reduction (LEADR) systems. The results of the Phase I effort, including establishment of concept designs, munition form factors, and test conditions, will guide prototype development and experimental testing activities in the Phase II."

        "Abstract": "Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that can be harnessed to increase the sensitivity of sensors, create unbreakable communication security, and enable powerful new computers. Space-based applications, however, require entangled photon sources that must operate in the presence of abundant sunlight. Because quantum techniques require the measurement of single photons, background light poses a formidable challenge. One of the major constraints limiting the effectiveness of filtering techniques is the large spectral bandwidth of the entangled photon sources themselves (~1-2nm). To address this problem, Qubitekk proposed to develop narrowband photon pair sources for space-based quantum communication. The Phase I effort revealed two approaches that are feasible with todayrsquo;s technology and these two will form the basis of the Phase II effort. The first approach is to filter the output of a conventional single-pass downconversion source and to compensate for the reduced output by increasing the pump laser power. The second approach is based on cavity-enhanced downconversion, in which the nonlinear crystal is placed in an optical cavity that has the effect of enhancing emission at resonant wavelengths and suppressing emission elsewhere. Although this approach is more complex, much narrower bandwidths can be achieved, not only offering greater background discrimination but also a source capable of coupling to matter-based qubits. The latter feature is an important element of quantum repeater development. These two approaches will be achieved through the execution of four Technical Objectives: 1) Demonstrate filtered downconversion with strong pump; 2) Conduct studies of filtered downconversion with realistic lighting conditions; 3) Demonstrate cavity-enhanced downconversion; and 4)Demonstrate narrowband photon detection using an etalon filter."

        "Abstract": "The broader\/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project aims to optimize post-processing techniques of a novel three-dimensional (3D) metal-printed orthodontic system for precise, personalized, and esthetic treatment. Approximately 60% of adults need orthodontic treatment to improve the position and function of their teeth; however, an obstacle to adults seeking orthodontic treatment is the unattractiveness and moderately painful nature of traditional braces. Up to 80% of these patients are not candidates for treatment with clear aligners due to the severity of their malocclusion (improper positioning of teeth). The proposed innovation is a complement to clear aligner therapy that will enable all patients to be treated with an invisible orthodontic appliance, regardless of malocclusion severity. 3D metal printing technology is used to fabricate custom, one-piece, metal attachments with a wire-holding channel that are placed on the back of the teeth and used in conjunction with clear aligners. Successful development of this product and its implementation in dentistry will shift the paradigm of tooth movement towards esthetic and effective personalized treatment with minimum tooth reduction and maximum comfort for millions of patients per year. The technology addresses a $30 billion market. The proposed project will optimize 3D metal printing as a high-potential technology for use in human orthodontia devices. Although additive manufacturing fabricates unique 3D structures from metal powder, layer-by-layer deposition results in a ladder structure and high surface roughness. Further, laser sintering could yield enriched chromium carbide grain boundary, which is not desirable, as it may lead to corrosion in the oral environment. Post-processing techniques to prepare 3D metal printed appliances for intraoral use have not yet been established. The funds from this SBIR grant will be used to complete the following aims: 1) Determine a polishing strategy for finishing 3D metal printed surfaces that reduces the surface roughness and creates a passive surface layer that is resistant to corrosion; 2) Evaluate in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility of the 3D metal printed brackets. A variety of polishing methods will be explored, including heat treatment, chemical solutions, and tumbling with an abrasive medium. The results of this research will be impactful to the millions of patients seeking invisible orthodontic treatment each year, as well as to the many manufacturers of medical and dental appliances that are developing custom 3D metal printed devices for better patient outcomes. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The soil microbiome is a complex system that plays a central role in biogeochemical processing of nutrients and impacts the exchange of trace species between the atmosphere and subsurface environment. Understanding how microbes thrive, under what conditions, and through the utilization of which resources is an important part of any assessment of ecosystem health and stability. Within this context, diatomic hydrogen is an important gas both as a byproduct of nitrogen fixation and as a nutrient for certain subsurface microbes. Hydrogen is produced at nitrogen fixing nodules on plant roots, then diffuses into soil, where it is released to the atmosphere or consumed by microbes. Consumption by microbes is the largest sink of atmospheric hydrogen, and the largest source of uncertainty in the global hydrogen budget. Identifying its production and consumption pathways, and how they are externally influenced, would inform our understanding of this important soil gas and its role in biogeochemical nutrient cycling. The concentration and isotopic signature of hydrogen are valuable indicators of the pathways responsible for its production and consumption in soil. Measurements of hydrogen are difficult due to its non-reactive nature and lack of an optical signature. In situ measurements are further complicated by the large concentration gradients of hydrogen near nitrogen-fixing centers. This DOE SBIR proposal is aimed at designing and developing a commercially viable system to measure hydrogen and its isotopic signature by leveraging recent advances in subsurface soil gas sampling and well-established laser- based detection technologies. The resulting product will be able to map subsurface hydrogen and its isotopic variant to determine production and consumption pathways in real-world soils and ecosystems. During Phase I, components of the proposed system will be developed and eventually combined for a benchtop demonstration of the system capabilities. These components include a sample preparation step to remove interfering species, a reaction step to quantitatively and selectively convert hydrogen to a molecule that can be detected using infrared laser spectroscopy, and a high-precision accurate detection platform that is field-deployable. These developments will aid in the design of a Phase II system for eventual commercialization. The proposed system will enable new measurements of an important subsurface gas, to refine nutrient cycling models, understand biological processes, and inform atmospheric budgets and models. This capability will be attractive to soil management and agricultural research markets due to the importance of hydrogen as a messenger of biological nitrogen fixation. It will also find value in the academic and governmental soil research community, where the role of hydrogen in subsurface processes and its impact on ecosystem health and stability is actively being explored."

        "Abstract": "This proposal addresses the specific need for \u201cnew technologies or methodologies to improve the field calibration\u201d for accurate measurements of aerosol scattering. Understanding the role that aerosols play in atmospheric radiative forcing is currently a major focus of the Department of Energy DOE) Atmospheric System Research ASR) and Atmospheric Radiation Measurement ARM) Programs. The asymmetry parameter, the ratio of the light scattered in the forward direction relative to that scattered into the backward hemisphere, is a critical optical property necessary in remote sensing, radiative transfer, and climate models. We propose to develop a commercial, state-of-the-art, portable instrument capable of measuring angular-dependent particulate scattering with high resolution; thus, providing a direct, accurate measure of the aerosol asymmetry parameter. Our proposed instrument will reduce the uncertainty in asymmetry parameter measurements and can be directly used as a field calibration of the current indirect, empirical method that DOE ARM employs as part of the Aerosol Optical Properties AOP) to derive the asymmetry parameter from filter-based absorption measurements and nephelometer backscatter measurements. Our approach is to sample particles through a circularly polarized 532 nm laser beam and collect scattered light using two position-sensitive detectors. A prototype, proof-of-concept, design has been built in Prof. Chakrabarty\u2019s aerosol laboratory and will be the basis for the proposed instrument. The instrument will detect the scattered light from 1\u00b0 to 168\u00b0 simultaneously, which allows for quick and efficient procurement of data, eliminates problems regarding aerosol stability, and will provide a direct and accurate determination of the aerosol asymmetry parameter. Successfully commercialized, our instrument will provide a fundamental measure of the optical properties of ambient aerosols that will enhance the accuracy of climate change predictions and will provide a critical missing component to the DOE ARM program. Successful development and marketing of this monitor will yield a significant level of direct commercial sales from researchers in the atmospheric sciences and air quality monitoring groups. The comparatively low cost and ease of use of this sensor will allow routine measurement of the angular- dependent scattering properties of atmospheric aerosols, which is not currently available."

        "Abstract": "Sustainable agricultural approaches to improve energy biofuel production and the production of chemical feedstocks are needed. Understanding the dynamics of plant-microbe-mineral interactions within the rhizosphere, the region in the soil closest to the roots, is particularly important in addressing agricultural sustainability. Oxygen (O2) is key to processes in the rhizosphere including microbial and root respiration, nitrogen-cycling including nitrification and denitrification, and the biodegradation and oxidation of organic contaminants. The subsurface oxygen concentration and isotopic signature can be leveraged to identify the different oxygen consumption or loss pathways, and its diffusion in and out of the rhizosphere region. The overall objective of this SBIR project is to develop a technique to detect subsurface oxygen and its isotopes with millimeter-scale spatial resolution, enabling direct interrogation of the rhizosphere. A microvolume probe is coupled with a reaction module and an infrared spectrometer, for precisely measuring the concentrations and isotopic signatures of oxygen. In Phase I a microvolume probe, reactor for conversion of O2 to carbon dioxide (CO2), and an interface connecting these units with a tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectrometer (TILDAS) were designed and built. The TILDAS instrument was configured for simultaneous measurement of the three most abundant oxygen isotopes of carbon dioxide, C16O16O, C16O18O and C16O17O. Laboratory tests of the combined probe, mixing volume, reactor, and TILDAS in a benchtop system successfully demonstrated measurement of oxygen and its isotopic signature in microvolume samples. The conversion parameters (e.g. oven temperature, heating time, reaction pressure) were optimized, achieving &gt;97% conversion of oxygen while minimizing isotopic fractionation. Tests in soil surrounding plant roots were successful, with a shift in the 18O isotopic ratio from ambient air observed. During the Phase II project the conversion technology and microvolume probes will be further refined. A field deployable prototype system consisting of probes, reactor, and TILDAS will be designed and built. The compatibility of the microvolume probes for other trace gas and VOC monitors will also be studied. The overall proposed system will be field demonstrated in soil experiments in a laboratory, greenhouse and at a DOE biofuel agricultural research facility. These experiments will provide proof of concept for the use of these mm-scale measurements to elucidate drivers of soil biogeochemical processes. Understanding how to work with and not against soil organisms is important for agricultural health and productivity. The proposed system will serve as a window into soil nutrient cycling, plant-microbe-mineral interactions, and effects of external forces (drought, flooding climate change) on soil processes. With this information, biofuel and soil research scientists, agronomists, and \u201csmart\u201d and precision farmers, will be able to identify and address key parameters to improve sustainable production at agricultural and bioenergy sites."

        "Abstract": "There is a need to improve the understanding of physical and chemical processes involved in the evolution of chemical warfare agent (CWA) simulant aerosols and vapors that are interacting with combustion, deflagration, and detonation products. However, the measurement of aerosols and vapors is very challenging because of limited knowledge of the photophysics at varying temperatures and pressures, spatial scales that span nm to cm, time scales from ns to ms, and 2D-3D multiphase phenomena. The proposed Phase II work will develop and transition high-fidelity diagnostics of simulant aerosols and vapors at high temperatures and pressures through five innovations that overcome these critical challenges. These include (1) differentiation of CWA simulant aerosol and vapor signals during single droplet evaporation, (2) improved photophysical understanding of CWA simulants at relevant temperatures and pressures, (3) extension of line-of-sight long-wave infrared (LWIR) absorption spectroscopy to multiple paths, laser sheets, and tomography, (4) application to mass flux measurements at the exit of fireball enclosures for DTRA applications, and (5) well characterized testing facilities and analytical tools for development of commercial instruments for rapid characterization of simulant aerosols and vapors."

To advance the knowledge of hydrometeors and their impact on hypersonic flight, it is critical, therefore, to develop practical, high-fidelity and spatio-temporally resolved three-dimensional measurements of their behavior under relevant conditions. The proposed research effort will (i) demonstrate and characterize three-dimensional imaging of hydrometeor aerobreakup in test facilities of interest to the ONR, especially for the most complex flowfields, (ii) optimize imaging schemes to cover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales and reduce ambiguities along the line of sight, (iii) simultaneously image the gas-phase using techniques such as laser-induced fluorescence, backward oriented schlieren, Rayleigh scattering, and\/or molecular tagging to capture three-dimensional state variables such as density, temperature, velocity, and species, and (iv) explore a portable diagnostics suite based on flexible, high-speed illumination sources that can be utilized with various detection or imaging modules and are carefully designed for test facilities of interest. This will lead to data on quantitative imaging of hydrometeor aerobreakup and a prototype commercial instrument for use in hypersonic test facilities."

This unique technology relies on continuous-wave laser heating of nanosized quantum emitter. The number of quantum emitters can be additively transferred onto any substrate or quantum devices. The whole transfer process can be conducted under ambient conditions without the need of vacuum or high voltage. The quantum-based temperature sensor to be developed will enable super-high spatial resolution of temperature down to sub-100 nm. It will also enable limited-space and remote temperature sensing because of the large bandwidth, low signal attenuation, and small footprint of the optical fiber. The proposed technology will also provide the DoD an affordable and rapid prototyping quantum sensing system, where the precise positioning of a single-photon source is ubiquitous but not been solved properly yet."

The SWERVI platform will be an integrated-photonics subsystem for the calibration of current and next-generation astronomical spectrographs with precision-radial velocity (PRV) sensitivity lt;10?cm\/s. The proposed module will use nonlinear nanophotonic waveguides to efficiently and controllably broaden the optical spectrum of an input frequency comb laser, to serve as the broadband calibration source in PRV measurements. The key innovations we will demonstrate in Phase 1 include: multi-stage broadening in high-nonlinearity tantala (Ta2O5), two-channel output to support self-referencing of the frequency comb, and high-average-power handling through robust packaging. When coupled with a high-repetition-rate comb source, the SWERVI system will enable new PRV calibration sources with spectral coverage virtually anywhere in the visible and near-infrared, while reducing power consumption and complexity through photonic integration. This system addresses a critical technology gap for extreme PRV measurements to detect and study exoplanets. Beyond PRV instrumentation, further development and commercialization of this nonlinear integrated-photonics platform will enable new capabilities in terrestrial and space-borne applications, such as atmospheric spectroscopy, precision timing and navigation, and optical communications."

        "Abstract": "X-ray spectroscopy techniques inform a vast array of science and engineering disciplines, since they can be used to make very high resolution maps of the elements contained in a sample, or the chemical reactive state of a sample\u2019s surface. One can see the metals or contaminants in a soil sample, verify the coating on a pharmaceutical pill, or even read an ancient text too fragile to open. Synchrotrons and X-ray free electron laser facilities are the power houses of X-ray spectroscopy research, and they need detector upgrades to keep up with X-ray beams which are too bright to be seen with existing detectors. This Phase I grant will be used to create a comprehensive commercialization strategy for an advanced new prototype detector. The prototype is a proof of principle with 10x10 pixels which can simultaneously measure X-ray energies. It is a new approach to X-ray detection, which will be tested in Phase I and then scaled up in Phase II with thousands of small pixels that frame at a high rate. This scheme will overcome the limitations of existing detectors and see many times more X-rays with high resolution, and increase experimental throughput and resolved details. This scheme is also the ideal solution for free electron laser facilities, which have a strong need but few suitable options for spectroscopy detectors. This project will create a desirable new, American-made world-class detector for spectroscopy research. In addition to their manufacture and export to facilities worldwide, these detectors will serve to accelerate research in both basic sciences and applied sciences\u2014from battery operation, soil science, and mining, to food safety and semiconductor manufacturing."

        "Abstract": "In recent years, powerful X-ray light source facilities such as synchrotrons and free electron lasers have been developed for studying the structure of matter down to the atomic scale, and to create \u201cmolecular movies\u201d of chemical reaction on time scales of picoseconds down to femtoseconds. To push the knowledge frontier across the many branches of science informed by these techniques, these facilities are continuing to upgrade their X-ray sources. As a consequence, these facilities come up against the limits of existing X-ray detectors to record intense X-ray pulses, and therefore they require new, advanced detectors with which to record their X-ray patterns. This project will use this grant to create a complete commercialization strategy for a newly- developed, high-resolution pixelated detector. This detector has the capability to integrate signals from X-ray patterns, and record them at orders of magnitude higher rate than possible with current detector products used at these facilities. This detector is also a perfect companion for free electron laser sources, which have few suitable options for measuring near- instantaneous X-ray diffraction and scattering. The excellent data quality produced by this detector will inform many branches of science utilizing the diffraction, scattering, and microscopy techniques at these X-ray facilities. Researches will be able to advance the properties of high-tech materials, microscopically visualize batteries during their operation, or even determine the structure and kinetics of biomolecules, leading to advances in medicine and pharmaceuticals."

        "Abstract": "Soil gas concentration data are critically importance for assessing regions of the surface and subsurface as part of developing a more accurate understanding of subsurface biogeochemical processes, production of gaseous end products, their relationship to microbe-catalyzed pathways of interest, and eventual release to the atmosphere across the subsurface-land surface interface. Mesa Photonics proposes development of a real-time, analyzer for soil gases at discrete depths based on Raman spectroscopy for simultaneous measurements of carbon dioxide, methane, oxygen, nitrogen, water vapor and hydrogen. Previous work has required gas sampling from monitoring wells. In this project Raman probes will be miniaturized for real-time downhole measurements. The probes are built entirely from fiber optics and we envision small diameter probes that are conceptually similar to medical imaging catheters. They will be flexible and easily positioned in porous soils or narrow diameter monitoring wells. Implement and test compact side-view fiber optic light collection for Raman spectroscopy. Assemble, test, and optimize a 532 nm laser source based on an amplified and frequency-doubled 1064 nm fiber laser. Compare performance sensitivity, signal- to-noise ratios, interference due to background light) of Raman gas detection using the frequency- doubled 1064 nm laser and using a commercial free-space 532 nm laser. Direct measurement of multiple soil gases including nitrogen now requires multiple analyzers. Commercial gas analyzers will be suitable for field studies including long-term continuous monitoring of nitrogen-cycle and carbon-cycle processes. Specific end user applications include characterizing biologic respiration, CH4 oxidation, dissolution of CO2, reaction with soil carbonate, and atmospheric mixing. Instruments will be easily transported for field work, fully automated, and self-calibrating."

        "Abstract": "Detailed accurate data on temperature variations and water vapor concentration distributions are needed for weather and climate forecasting. Water vapor is particularly important for predicting precipitation amounts from storms. Measurements are needed from the ground to the top of the troposphere at about 10 km altitude. Existing ground-based instruments often have measurement uncertainties due to the complexities of data analysis. Ground-based laser heterodyne radiometers will be developed for quantitative measurements of water vapor and oxygen (O2) optical absorbances in transmitted sunlight. Oxygen column retrievals are simplified because O2 concentrations are nearly invariant throughout the troposphere. This simplifies temperature and pressure retrievals that can then be used to improve the quality of the H2O retrievals. The Phase I project met or exceeded all objectives. A suitable wavelength region was identified for simultaneous measurements of water vapor and oxygen, the wavelength region was validated experimentally, and software development began for retrieving concentration and temperature profiles from the ground-based heterodyne measurements. Improvements identified in Phase I will be implemented with an emphasis on improving wavelength precision and accuracy. Up to three instruments will be assembled and field tested. The technology will be tested and validated in field tests including deployment at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains site and the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center. Our technology is (1)a lower-cost method for validating data from more complicated and expensive instruments that generate data complicated by multiple scattering and distributed emission volumes and (2)a new method for remote sensing of natural gas leakage."

        "Abstract": "Ultrafast lasers are used or proposed for use in many areas of accelerator applications; for example, drivers for novel accelerator concepts for future colliders and in the generation, manipulation, and x-ray seeding of electron beams. While end-to-end modeling of ultrafast laser systems is important for the development of new sources, model verification is also needed for the development of higher power and more efficient ultrafast laser systems and amplifiers. Standard ultrafast laser pulse measurement systems, no matter how compact, are relatively large devices that require a beam input. In order to measure the pulse at an arbitrary location within an ultrafast system, the pulse must be sampled at the desired measurement location. In this SBIR, we will develop new methods to measure ultrafast laser pulses throughout an optical system, which will help to verify models for ultrafast optical systems including amplifiers. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed techniques for the measurement of ultrafast laser pulses anywhere within an optical system. Models of optical systems will be verified as well as the accuracy and precision of our measurement technique. Our ultrafast laser pulse measurement technology will provide badly needed diagnostics in commercial markets. Our ultrafast pulse measurement technology will be used for scientific research, manufacturing, and the semiconductor industry."

        "Abstract": "Laser guide stars (LGS) are artificial sources of light produced by laser-induced fluorescence from sodium atoms in the mesosphere between 85 km and 100 km altitude. The fluorescence can be detected on the ground with a telescope and used as a reference for compensating atmospheric aberrations in astronomical and space observations in conjunction with an adaptive optics system. Sodium LGS are vital for the next generation of large ground-based visible-light telescopes. Additional applications include space-debris and object tracking and imaging, ground-to-satellite laser communication, and potentially even interplanetary laser communication. Laser guide stars can also be adapted for atmospheric and remote-sensing applications; in particular, LGS can be used for remote magnetometry by modulating the light beam and observing a resonance when the modulation frequency matches the spin-precession Larmor frequency of sodium atoms in the mesosphere. For any of these applications, an increase in LGS brightness would be desirable; for daytime operation it is essential. This requires experimental and computational research into new LGS methodologies. We propose work to achieve two objectives: Objective 1: Development of enhanced user-friendly LGS modeling software. The open-source LGSBloch package, developed by Rochester Scientific, is currently the primary software serving the adaptive-optics sodium LGS modeling community. However, it could benefit from major improvements in capabilities, computational efficiency, and user-friendliness. We propose to add capabilities to efficiently model pulsed and modulated light (including amplitude and polarization modulation), to model alternative and multi-level pumping schemes, including those in other potentially useful atomic systems (e.g., iron), to integrate over the laser-beam volume, and include atmospheric and mesospheric propagation effects, as well as including a user-friendly graphical user interface to facilitate use by those who are not atomic-physics specialists. Objective 2: Feasibility study of brightness-enhanced laser guide stars based on mesospheric iron. Methodologies for brighter laser guide stars would have civilian and military commercial applications including astronomy, space-object tracking, and laser-based communication. We propose to study the possibility for one such method, namely basing an LGS on mesospheric iron atoms, rather than sodium.\u00a0 Mesospheric iron may have benefits including brighter daytime operation and polychromatic LGS for tip-tilt correction. The iron-LGS study will include several components: modeling single-color LGS and polychromatic LGS, investigating the benefits of polarization modulation and frequency chirping for LGS brightness, and determining whether a directed-beam iron LGS employing amplified spontaneous emission is possible. Each component of the study will include both computational modeling and auxiliary laboratory experiments for validation."

        "Abstract": "The broader\/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to start validating a novel high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) device for minimally invasive treatment of brain tumors. The current standard of care is a highly invasive cranial flap resection, which not only risks infection, uncontrolled bleeding, and damage to healthy tissue, but also has prolonged post-operative recovery. Although minimally invasive laser ablation tools have been developed, they require the probe to be inserted directly into the target, which still risks bleeding and damaging tissue. Furthermore, while minimally invasive HIFU tools are available for other conditions, new technologies are needed to address more distant focal points and account for tissue-specific effects in the brain. This device is designed to: 1) reduce risks of infection, bleeding, and incidental damage to tissue; 2) reduce operating (and hence anesthesia) time; and 3) improve quality of life for patients by promoting faster recovery and improved aesthetics. The target addressable market is estimated to be nearly $1 B, with an additional $283 M per year for disposable kits and maintenance\/upgrades. This SBIR Phase I project is developing a novel high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) device offering a minimally invasive alternative to cranial flap resections to remove brain tumors. The key differentiating advantage of this technology is in the combination of: 1) a probe that is inserted through a minimally invasive burr hole in the skull, allowing a much smaller incision size compared to a cranial flap surgery; and 2) the use of HIFU, which can be focused at a distance from the tip of the transducer (without inserting the tip directly into the target). The main technical hurdles to be addressed are to 1) design a miniaturized therapeutic ultrasound transducer to allow safe insertion into the brain while maintaining similar acoustic properties to a larger transducer; and 2) include capabilities to steer the focus of HIFU to ablate larger targets of complex geometry. To achieve these goals, the project will: 1) create a digital model to miniaturize an existing prototype that maintains acoustic performance and integrates HIFU steering capabilities; 2) fabricate a physical prototype matching the predicted acoustic power capabilities; and 3) show proof-of-concept functionality of the prototype in a phantom material and human cadaver brain. If successful, the final deliverable will be a prototype ready for preclinical validation. This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nSummary\nThe Brimrose Technology Corporation and Johns Hopkins University are forming a powerful new team to make\na new instrument that has the potential to dramatically reduce a major global health problem\u2013perinatal hypoxic-\nischemic encephalopathy (HIE)\u2013by enabling early detection during labor. HIE caused by asphyxia is a leading\ncause of infant fatalities as well as a source of cerebral palsy and other long-term severe neurologic\nimpairments. The medical community has been limited in early diagnosis of HIE because current fetal heart\nrate monitoring has poor specificity. If identified early, HIE can be treated effectively with therapeutic\nhypothermia. We are proposing a fetal photoacoustic monitoring system that measures oxyhemoglobin\nsaturation of the sagittal sinus vein draining the fetal cerebral cortex during labor. Sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin\nsaturation decreases to very low levels when placental gas exchange is impaired (hypoxia) and\/or when fetal\ncerebral perfusion pressure falls (ischemia). The photoacoustic instrument transmits light through the open\nfontanelle or bone and into cerebral veins and tissue where ultrasound waves are generated. Using near-\ninfrared incident light at discrete wavelengths that are absorbed preferentially by oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin,\nultrasound detected on the fetal scalp at each wavelength can estimate oxyhemoglobin saturation. Brimrose\nhas constructed a novel ultrasound detection technology with sensitivity orders of magnitude greater than the\ncurrent best-use piezo-electric sensors. This will permit the use of low-power LED light sources rather than\ncumbersome laser lights now employed, thereby avoiding safety goggle use and promoting greater\ndeployment. The Hopkins team has already validated the ability of a standard photoacoustic system to\naccurately estimate sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin saturation through the skull of newborn piglets. The purpose\nof Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of using safe, low power LED light sources with the new\nultrasensitive ultrasound sensor to detect critically low sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin saturation when\noxygenation is manipulated. The platform will be based on in-silico simulation to optimize the acoustic and\noptical pathways for the skull and brain. Real-time measurements on a time scale of seconds will inform the\nobstetric caregiver of dynamic fluctuations of brain oxygenation during contractions. The Phase II goal is to\nmake a miniaturized photoacoustic device prototype that can report on fetal brain oxygenation. We believe the\nresulting instrument will provide early detection brain HI with greater specificity and sensitivity, enabling early\nintervention and treatment and is potentially transferrable to a commercial model for manufacture.PROJECT NARRATIVE\nThe Brimrose Technology Corporation and the Johns Hopkins University propose making a new instrument to\npotentially dramatically reduce the incidence of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), which can result in\nmortality or lifelong disabilities. Our goal is to develop an intrapartum fetal brain monitor using photoacoustics\nwith inexpensive, safe and clinically convenient light emitting diodes (LEDs) to noninvasively and\ninstantaneously identify the fetus at risk for brain injury. Phase I is intended to provide a proof-of-concept using\nlow power LED light sources and a novel ultrasensitive ultrasound detector rather than standard laser light\nsources and piezo-electric detectors."

A novel all-optical technique, LIBS + LITE shows promising potentials in standoff in-situ chemical-biological detection in the operation field due to their excellent versatility and operational simplicity. LIBS + LITE spectrometer rapidly identifies the contaminants with absolute precision in a warzone or hazardous civilian area meters away without any sample preparation required. This proposed LIBS + LITE instrument will be an integrated system that mounts the LIBS + LITE detector units on an unmanned aerial systems and synchronizes the flight path of the UAS and the excitation laser beam to probe the contaminated surface. This design would protect the reconnaissance platforms from contamination due to contact with the chemical hazard. The proposed detection system will be the first laser ablation atomic and molecular detection system with rapid remote interrogation and geospatial mapping capabilities of surface contamination."

        "Abstract": "Ceramics have utility as optically transparent materials in optical fibers, lenses, solid state lasers, optical windows, and heat-seeking devices for missile guidance systems. Polycrystalline ceramics are limited by the incident light that is scattered by microstructural features; higher scattering results in higher opacity. Reduction in the crystalline particle size below the wavelength of the incident radiation can result in translucent or even transparent material. Manufacturing advances have brought polycrystalline ceramics to the fore in radome, sensor protection and multi-spectral window applications. These ceramics must exhibit superior optical properties to control the spectral bandwidth of operation, have the abrasion resistance and strength expected for armor, and high thermal stability for the demanding operational environment. Missile defense applications require state of the art transparent optics with exceptional thermo-mechanical properties. ASCM proposes its CVC SiC\u00ae for window and radome applications. ASCM has demonstrated production of meter-class CVC SiC\u00ae monoliths and transparent structures. In this program ASCM will develop and refine the CVC SiC\u00ae process to maximize transparent optical performance, while maintaining the upper tier thermo-mechanical properties of the native material.

        "Abstract": "Robotic systems in general, and Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAVs) in particular, pose a threat for both military and civilians when in the wrong hands. The triad of Kinetic, High-Power Microwave and Laser weapon systems currently used or considered for Counter-UAV (C-UAV) operation though effective in disrupting their performance, might be hazardous when used in a populated area. In this Phase I program AS&amp;T proposes an alternative technology with its C-UAV denial enactment based on the use of the laser-induced broadband RF radiation. Phase I activities include the feasibility study of its proposed C-UAV concept and analysis of the performance and specification of the LAPLAS system to be developed for its execution. The feasibility study consists of modeling, simulation and laboratory validation of the LAPLAS breadboard. Practical implementation and experimental evaluation of a fully assembled system will be performed in Phase II. The Phase II activities will include design, integration and testing of the LAPLAS prototype. The program will culminate with lab testing of the LAPLAS prototype, and conclude with field-validate and demonstration of its performance in a scenario relevant to potential\/prospective operational environment."

Existing solutions operate over a narrow spectral band, have small field-of-view (FOV), have large size, weight and power (SWaP) and do not meet the requirements of the solicitation. Trex proposes a wearable Laser Alert System (LAS), which overcomes all limitations of existing systems and is constructed using ultra-low-cost COTS components. It operates over a large spectral band (450-1600nm), has an ultra large (220\u00b0) FOV, and has low size, weight and power (SWaP) with mass &lt; 100g, volume = 1.5 cu inch, and can operate for 192 hours on a single battery charge. LAS can discriminate laser against non-laser sources with low false alarm rate because a diffractive grating produces different effects on light from a narrowband laser and a broadband background source.\u00a0 A processing algorithm accurately rejects background sources based on their size and lack of sharp higher order diffraction lobes present in the image of a narrowband laser source.

Ion traps offer properties such high isolation from the environment, long life-times, and individual addressability of atomic qubits. However, ground up development of a research grade ion trap suitable for quantum commuting applications is a limiting factor because the process is highly resource consuming. AOSense proposes to design and develop a vacuum packaged ion trapping system suitable for quantum computing applications. The effort will leverage our expertise on the development of advanced laser systems for state-of-the-art atomic physics applications, and the development of fieldable quantum devices that share numerous similarities to trapped-ion-based experiments."

        "Abstract": "Environmental structures of interest like mountains, tunnels, and deposits of minerals, oil or gas produce distortions in the local gravitational field. Sensing gravity anomalies and comparing them to a gravity map can provide positioning immune to the drift of purely inertial navigation systems. Existing gradiometers with sufficient sensitivity are large and heavy, requiring manned aircraft and helicopters for their operation. This makes comprehensive high-resolution gravity mapping slow, risky in terrain-hugging (low and slow) flight, and expensive. We propose to develop an unmanned aerial vehicle with an integrated atom-optic gravity gradiometer. Such a system combines the unparalleled sensitivity of quantum sensors with the utility of an unmanned aerial platform. This sensor would eliminate risk to a flight crew, make surveying less conspicuous, and allow automated terrain-hugging flight. This, in turn, would enable measuring gravity with high spatial resolution, with high sensitivity, and at low cost."

        "Abstract": "The design of next-generation petawatt-scale femtosecond laser systems will require parallel multiphysics simulations with realistic errors and nonlinear optimization. End-to-end 4D modeling (3D with explicit time dependence) is essential to accurately capture and mitigate problems such as pre-pulses and post- pulses arising from optical imperfections. Existing commercial software does not address these requirements. Modeling of bulk media lasers will be addressed by developing 3 computational modules. The gain module will capture 3D pump energy distribution and associated thermal lensing in the crystal amplifier, as well as amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). Slice-by-slice pumping and depletion of stretched pulses will be included to capture wavelength-dependent gain and spectral evolution. The optics module will provide wavefront propagation with full physical optics, including all apertures and lenses. Realistic input parameters for the seed and pump beams will be taken from experimental measurements. Use of the gain and optics modules together will capture essential aspects of pulse stretching and compression. Multi-pass and multi-pump geometries will be considered. The thermal module will capture all relevant aspects of thermal transport in the crystal. The 3 modules together will capture the evolution of hot spots. The 3 modules will be prototyped, including inter-module interactions. The thermal module will be built on commercial computer-aided engineering software. A prototype browser-based GUI will be developed, leveraging the company\u2019s open source technology for scientific cloud computing. A novel treatment of wavefront propagation through the crystal amplifier will work with arbitrary meshed wavefronts. This, together with inclusion of nonidealized thermal effects on the 3D gain profile, will enable initial modeling of localized thermal maxima (i.e. hot spots) in the crystal. The software developed for this project will be open source, and novel aspects of the software design will be published in the scientific literature. The cloud computing approach is uniquely powerful. New users can be up and running in minutes, and can share their simulations with collaborators instantaneously. The open source business model enables low-cost delivery of free access to basic capabilities for many users. Use of a commercial computer-aided engineering package for the fully detailed simulations will enable upselling of the complete software capabilities to paying customers."

        "Abstract": "As computational density for high- performance computing and big-data services continues to scale, performance scalability of next generation computing systems is becoming increasingly constrained by limitations in memory access, power dissipation and chip packaging. The processor-memory communication bottleneck, a major challenge in current multicore processors due to limited pin-out and power budget, presents a detrimental scaling barrier to data-intensive computing. A consortium team of small businesses and leading researchers that includes experts from photonics processor-memory architecture, III\/V photonic laser design\/fabrication, silicon photonics design\/fabrication, photonics packaging and assembly, and FPGA-based high performance memory controller IP development \u2013 to collaboratively develop a commercialization path for a Photonic Memory Controller Module (P-MCM). The proposed work for Phase II (still ongoing) is to create an optical CPU-memory link utilizing both robust MZI based athermal bidirectional links (at 30Gbs) and also microring based denser WDM structures. The Phase II, specially the MZI based approach, enabled us to demonstrate record breaking optical links and set the stage for the commercialization stage. The exceptional high power and high temperature operation of the lasers developed by Freedom Photonics and the low loss coupling work performed by PLCC has made the planning for Phase IIb more straightforward. In this effort, we are proposing the commercialization of high-capacity short-reach ("

        "Abstract": "Methylene chloride has been widely employed in Air Force Depots to remove painting off the aircraft components for maintenance, which creates unsafe working conditions and causes significant logistic and financial burdens. So far, alternative depaint methods has been labor-intensive and substrate damaging (abrasive media blasting and water-jet), and expensive and small coverage (laser and atmospheric plasma). To that end, Ultool, LLC and its academic partner proposes a large area ion depaint process that is environmentally benign, non-damaging, batch process compatible, rugged, and efficient. Moreover, it generates minimum waste streams and does not create chemistry to interfere with Air Force Depot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downstream industrial wastewater treatment plant (IWTP). If successful, it will help Air Force Depots to improve operator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s working condition, reduce waste streams, and meet future regulatory restrictions while still meeting mission critical maintenance efficiency."
